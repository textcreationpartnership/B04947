            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Prayer is a confeſſion of the true ſtate of our own Souls and Bodies, as well as of Gods moſt excellent Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>God is moſt honoured by Publick Prayers.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN confidering the firſt of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Nature of Prayer,</hi> we may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther look upon it as an act whereby we honour God; or as an act, whereby we ſeek our own good. And either way the Publick Prayers, which many offer to God with joynt conſent, will appear to have the preheminence above all other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſay, if we have reſpect to God in what we perform in this Holy Duty, it is evident He is much more Honoured by our publick addreſſes to him, than he can be by any thing we
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:179513:57"/>do in private: There indeed we may Worſhip him very acceptably, and find the Bleſſed Effects of it, in God's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Communications of himſelf unto us, ſutable to our neceſſities: provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded we do not neglect his publick Worſhip; which the private ought not to hinder, but promote, becauſe in truth, it is defective without the publick; being only Worſhip, but not Honour, Glory, or Service.</p>
               <p>We read of all theſe four frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Holy Scriptures, <hi>Worſhip, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Glory,</hi> and <hi>Service.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> of which may be performed in the moſt ſecret place; but the other <hi>three</hi> have reſpect to what is done in Publick. In our mind, indeed, we Honour God, whereſoever we Worſhip him; if we have an high eſteem of his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: but we do him no Honour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs others ſee by outward Signs and Tokens the inward regard we have to Him; or we make the voice of his praiſe to be heard among them. Then we <hi>give him the Honour due unto his Name,</hi> when others are Witneſſes of the eſteem we have of his Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, by ſuch actions as naturally
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:179513:57"/>declare it; <hi>viz.</hi> by our ſolemn Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend acknowledgement of him, in his publick Worſhip. Upon which if we do not attend, men have reaſon to think we are void of all ſenſe of him, and have no reſpect to him.</p>
               <p>For the Honour that is done to any one among men, is alwayes a publick thing; as thoſe words of <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Samuel</hi> teſtifie 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xv. 30. <hi>Honour me before the Elders of my people, and before Iſrael.</hi> Thus <hi>Haman</hi> underſtood the word <hi>Honour,</hi> when <hi>Abaſuerus</hi> ſaid <hi>What ſhall be done unto the man, whom the King delighteth to Honour?</hi> For thinking with himſelf there was none in whom the King delighted ſo much as himſelf, he anſwered, <hi>Let the Royal Apparel be brought forth, and the Horſe on which the King is wont to ride,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſet the man thereon, and let it be proclaimed before him, Thus ſhall it be done to the man whom the King delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to honour,</hi> vi. Eſth. 6, 7, &amp;c. For he knew, that unleſs ſomething was done in publick, it would be no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him that received it. For who can tell what is in anothers mind (in which Honour lies) without ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:179513:58"/>ſigns, as are real teſtimonies of his inward thoughts, opinion, eſteem, and affection?</p>
               <p>Thus the Angel inſtructs <hi>Tobias</hi> and his Son about the Worſhip of God: <hi>Bleſs God, praiſe him, magnifie him, bleſs him for the things he hath done unto you, in the ſight of all that live. It is good to praiſe God and exalt his Name, and honourably,</hi> (or <hi>with honour</hi> as the words are in the Greek) <hi>to ſhew forth the works of God. Therefore be not ſlack to praiſe him: it is good to keep cloſe the ſecrets of a King; but it is honour able to reveal,</hi> or to publiſh <hi>the works of God.</hi> xii. Tob. 6, 7. Which is the ſenſe of the Pſalmiſt, cxlv. Pſal. 4, 5. <hi>One Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration ſhall praiſe thy Works to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhall declare thy mighty acts. I will ſpeak of the glorious Honour of thy Majeſty; and of thy wondrous works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what hath been ſaid concerning honouring God, may, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be affirmed of <hi>giving him Glory;</hi> that it is done by publick actions: it being nothing elſe, but the publiſhing and ſpreading the fame of his Divine Perfections, or of his wondrous Works. This we learn, as from many paſſages
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:179513:58"/>in the Pſalmiſt, ſo from our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf. Who a little before his departure from this World, lift up his eyes to Heaven, and ſaid, <hi>Father, I have glorified thee on Earth:</hi> that is,
<note place="margin">xvii. Joh. 4.</note> made him known to be what he is, publiſhed his whole Will and Pleaſure, and done whatſoever he commanded him. And in like manner told his Apoſtles, <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is my Father glorified, if ye bear much fruit:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">xv. Joh. 8.</note> in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is, his Holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and bringing many to the belief of it. Which is ſufficient to ſhow, that if we do not honour God by what we do in private; much leſs do we <hi>glorifie</hi> him, which wholly refers to proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Name, and ſetting forth his Praiſe.</p>
               <p>And from all this it follows that we cannot be ſaid to do him any <hi>ſervice,</hi> by our private addreſſes to him: whereby we only ſerve our ſelves. For then we ſerve <hi>him</hi> by our Worſhip, when we openly acknowledge him, and own him to be what indeed he is, the great Creator, and moſt wiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the World: who therefore
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:179513:59"/>(we hereby teſtifie and declare) ought in our opinion, to be Worſhipped by all men, with the ſame reverend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard which we pay unto him.</p>
               <p>In brief, we do him Honour, when we openly declare with that Bleſſed company we read of in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> iv. <hi>ult.</hi> that he is <hi>worthy to receive Glory, and Honour, and Power: for thou, O Lord</hi> (ſay they) <hi>haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are, and were created.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then we alſo <hi>glorifie</hi> him, when we declare his <hi>greatneſs, and goodneſs; and ſpeak of the Glory of his Kingdom, and talk of his power. Worſhipping the Lord in the beauty of Holineſs,</hi> or in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sanctuary; as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks xxix. 2. cxlv. 6, 11, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And hereby we <hi>ſerve</hi> him very much, and do ſomething, which promotes his Intereſt in the World: whereas all that we do in private, only promotes our own.</p>
               <p>This I ſhall explain in three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Publick Worſhip of God doth him great ſervice, by maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſenſe of God in the World, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:179513:59"/>preſerving the notion of him: which would be in danger to be loſt, if his Worſhip were only in ſecret, or among a few perſons privately; where no body knew what they did, but they themſelves. Such cloſe and retired Devotion would have no power to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and keep up a Religious regard, to the Almighty Creator of all things, among his Creatures. All that it could do, muſt be upon thoſe particular men themſelves who ſecretly Worſhipped him; but upon others it could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all: for how could that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the knowledge of God, which was not it ſelf known? And how prone would men be to conclude, that the being of God was only a dark fancy in ſome mens minds; whoſe ſingle opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could have no Authority at all: but rather be deſpiſed; as being aſhamed to own it ſelf, or having no publick approbation? Which the Publick Worſhip of God gives it; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupports the belief of God's being in mens minds, as the common ſenſe of Mankind: but is apt to ſtrike men with ſome awe of him, when they ſee a great many, with humble Devotion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:179513:60"/>and reverence, with bended knees, and eyes lifted up to Heaven, paying their ſolemn acknowledgments to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. Eſpecially when they ſee him thus adored, by men of the greateſt place, and in the higheſt reputation for Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge: who will have an heavy account to give unto the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord and Judge of all, if they do not contribute to the upholding his Authority among Men; by frequenting the publick Aſſemblies, and by their reverend deportment there.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Whereby not only a ſenſe of him in general is preſerved; but a ſenſe alſo of his Greatneſs and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence (as I may call it) is alſo bred and nouriſhed in mens minds. Who joyning as one Man in the ſame ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, are taught not only <hi>that God</hi> is, but <hi>what</hi> he is; infinite in all perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For when a multitude of people meet together, even as many as a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious place can contain, to Worſhip the ſame Being; it doth moſt naturally ſignifie and declare, that He is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great and glorious, whom ſo many own for their Lord; upon whom they depend for all they have or can have:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:179513:60"/>which is not ſignified, nor repreſented, when only one or two, or a few pray to Him.</p>
               <p>Therefore this is a reaſon, both that we ſhould hold publick Aſſemblies; and that they ſhould be as full, as is poſſible, and all, who belong to them, ſhould croud unto them: to teſtifie that they look upon him, who is there Worſhipped, to be the <hi>great King over all the Earth,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, xlvii. 2. For great numbers meeting together to do their Homage to him, it is the moſt natural ſign that can be contrived (which private Worſhip is not) that we take him to be the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign of the World, the Lord of all, above all; good unto all, in one word, the common Parent of us all; to whom we reſort for his Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>This is a demonſtration that Publick Worſhip is to be preferred before all other, becauſe moſt ſutable to his moſt excellent Majeſty; the beſt token of the high thoughts we have of him; the utmoſt we are able to do, to teſtifie how great and how good we believe him to be, how able and willing to help us all, as being equally related un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:179513:61"/>
               <p>And the more meet together for this end, the better this is declared; that he cannot be honoured and glorified enough: but we ſtand in need of the united thoughts and affections of all Mankind, could they be aſſembled at once, to magnifie his incomparable perfections.</p>
               <p>Nay, If all Creatures in Heaven and in Earth (as a very worthy Perſon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) could meet together in one Body, to Worſhip Him, at the ſame time and in the ſame place, it would ſtill be much better: becauſe more ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to His Moſt Excellent Majeſty; being ſtill a better ſignification of his Infinite perfections, and of his vaſt Dominions, which he governs with inconceiveable Wiſdom, and takes care of with a moſt provident goodneſs.</p>
               <p>And though no one place here on Earth, is big enough to contain ſo much as one Nation, or Country, or great City; yet we meeting in ſeveral places of the ſame kind, and ſet apart for the ſame purpoſe to Worſhip God, at one and the ſame time, it approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſomething near unto this: all the people that are under one and the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:179513:61"/>ſame Government, hereby ſetting forth God's praiſe together, at the very ſame moment, and in the like, though not the very ſame individual place; where they uniformly acknowledge him with joynt conſent to be their common Preſerver and Benefactor. Which is far more agreeable to the perfection of his moſt excellent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than the ſingle or private Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations that are made to him: in which there is no ſenſible Declaration made what he is able to do for all; but only what he is able to do for one, or for a few.</p>
               <p>For which reaſon the Univerſal Church anciently obſerved, certain ſet hours of Prayers; that all Chriſtians throughout the World might at the ſame time joyn together to glorifie God: and ſome of them
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Origen</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>N.</hi> 33, 35.</note> were of opinion, that the Angelical Hoſt, being acquainted with thoſe hours, took that time to joyn their Prayers and Praiſes with thoſe of the Church. For common reaſon led them to this thought, that thoſe noble Creatures are highly concern'd to ſet forth, to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:179513:62"/>the utmoſt of their Power, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Honour of God's Majeſty: who as he is exalted above all Bleſſing and Praiſe, ſo hath the utmoſt pitch of Praiſe, to which Creatures can reach, given unto Him; when the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Heaven and Earth combine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at once, to Worſhip Him.</p>
               <p>Thence it was that the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> though many of them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly concerned himſelf, were directed to the <hi>Chief Muſitian,</hi> for the Publick Service: as the way <hi>to make his Praiſe glorious.</hi> So the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks in lxvi. <hi>Pſalm;</hi> which begins with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that <hi>all Lands would make a joyful noiſe unto God, and ſing forth the honour of his Name, and make his Praiſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi> That is, this was the way to do ſomething ſutable to the ſurpaſſing Glory of his Majeſty. For <hi>great</hi> (ſaith he elſewhere) <hi>is the Lord, and</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>greatly to be praiſed in the City of our God.</hi> xlviii Pſal. 1. He was not <hi>greatly praiſed,</hi> ſutably to his greatneſs; unleſs it were in that place, where they all met together to praiſe him. No, the very private Bleſſings beſtowed on <hi>David,</hi> he would have publickly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:179513:62"/>by all the people. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not only ſay, <hi>I will bleſs the Lord, at all times, his praiſe ſhall be continually in my mouth. My Soul ſhall make her boaſt of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. but adds, <hi>O magnifie the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.</hi> xxxiv. Pſal. 1, 2, 3. And therefore much more were the common Bleſſings poured on them all, to be thus acknowledged: and his <hi>praiſe ſung in the Congregation of Saints,</hi> as the words are cxlix. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. that is, by all the people of the Jews. Nay, by all the people on the face of the Earth, as he ſpeaks cxvii. Pſal. <hi>O praiſe the Lord, all ye Nations; praiſe him all ye people, &amp;c.</hi> Which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhows, in the xv. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. was accompliſhed; when the Gentiles ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Chriſt, and became Members of his Church: therein to praiſe him continually in their publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In which the ſenſe of God will not only be preſerved, ſutable to his moſt excellent greatneſs and goodneſs: but preſerved pure and ſincere; free from thoſe dangerous mixtures which may ſooner creep into it, to corrupt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:179513:63"/>and embaſe it, if he ſhould be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped only in private. Where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man may frame conceits of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, agreeable to his own inclinations: and there is no ſuch way to prevent or correct them, as by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon the publick Offices of Religion. Into which Errors are not ſo eaſily admitted; becauſe men are naturally careful about that which they expoſe to the publick view: not being willing themſelves to appear before others with ſuch neglect, as they are ſometimes found in when they are alone. Or if there be any thing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous admitted there, it will ſoon be diſcovered; and if not redreſſed, yet oppoſed by good men: as all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been at their firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, though in proceſs of time they have prevailed.</p>
               <p>They began in private; and from thence, by degrees adventurnd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in publick: where they would have appeared ſooner, if the common ſenſe of Mankind, or of Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had not been againſt them.</p>
               <p>There is nothing ſo ſound, but in time it may be tainted: yet it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:179513:63"/>the longer to remain ſound, when there is a publick care about it. And, beſides, when it is corrupted, it is not in ſo many things, as it would have been; had the ſervice of God been left only to every mans private management: for then there may be as many falſe imaginations as there are men, and the whole Body of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion intirely depraved.</p>
               <p>As it is an Act therefore whereby we do honour unto God, Prayer ought to be publick: that it may be ſeen we own him, and honour him; and that he may be honoured ſutably to his tranſcendent greatneſs, and his Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal goodneſs. Which require that he be univerſally acknowledged, as not merely a particular Benefactor, but as the common Father of us all: whoſe Munificence is declared to be the greater, when he hath a number of Clients, and as many thankful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; who come together upon the ſame buſineſs to proclaim his praiſe, and ſhow forth the wonderful works he hath done for them.</p>
               <p>In ſumm, As a great multitude of poor people conſtantly waiting at the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:179513:64"/>Gates of an houſe, ſpeak him that dwells in it, to be far more liberal and bountiful, than he would be believed, if few or none were ſeen expecting there: even ſo do the Aſſemblies of pious Supplicants and devout Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers ſpread the fame of God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſted goodneſs far and near; of which there is no notice at all when few or none tread in the Courts of his houſe, but content themſelves with a private attendance on him. This ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much damps the ſenſe of God; at leaſt of his infinite greatneſs and goodneſs: and as it repreſents him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a poor and mean faſhion; ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers the propagation of ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of him, as will diſparage and diſhonour him.</p>
               <p>For which reaſon, there is no ſerious Chriſtian, who layes things to heart, but muſt needs be grieved and ſigh, to ſee ſuch ſtately ſtructures, as our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Churches (which were built to contain a multitude of Worſhippers, and to repreſent the inconceivable greatneſs of him who is there Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped) ſo very empty and void of people, in our daily Aſſemblies: as if we had
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:179513:64"/>forſaken God, or had loſt all ſenſe of the honour that is due unto him. This is a thing very much to be lamented, and ſpeedily amended; leſt God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake us, and make us a reproach, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the Prophet ſpeaks, that he hath no delight in us: becauſe we have diſhonoured his Holy Name, and take no delight in his Divine Service.</p>

            <div n="12" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Publick Prayers moſt advantagious unto us.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>LET us now proceed to conſider the <hi>ſecond</hi> part of this Argument; which hath reſpect unto Prayer as an act, whereby we ſeek our own good: And it will appear as plainly, that the publick Prayers contribute moſt unto it. If we had no other reaſon to aſſert this, but that now named, it were ſufficient, that God is hereby moſt honoured. For whatſoever doth him moſt Honour, will certainly do us moſt good: according to his own
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:179513:65"/>Maxime; <hi>Him that honoureth me, I will honour: but he that deſpiſeth me, ſhall be highly eſteemed,</hi> 1 Sam. ii. 30. But we have other reaſons alſo, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that if we have reſpect to our ſelves in our Prayers, and the good we derive thereby upon our Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and all our concerns; it leads us to the Publick Prayers, as likely to be moſt prevalent.</p>
               <p n="1">I. For <hi>firſt,</hi> We may pray there with much more confidence, than we can in thoſe private Petitions we put up to God: both becauſe the things we ask publickly are approved as needful and good in the judgment of all; and are alſo ſought for and deſired by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent. And therefore we may be the more aſſured, they are good for us; and being ſo, ſhall be beſtowed upon us.</p>
               <p>This is a thing of very great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Prayer, to have a confidence of being heard. Which we cannot have, as St. <hi>John</hi> teaches us, unleſs we not only <hi>keep God's Commandments, and do thoſe things which are pleaſing in his ſight</hi> (1 Joh. iii. 22) but alſo <hi>ask ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

Now the matter of our Prayers cannot be ſo well warranted to be <hi>according to God's will,</hi> when they are only of private concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is, when they have the ſtamp of publick Authority: and therefore in our ſingle Devotions, we muſt needs fall ſhort of that degree of confidence, which we may have, when we joyn in Prayer with all our Chriſtian Brethren; who agree to ask the ſame thing, with a ſetled belief that it is agreeable to his will.</p>
               <p>Common Reaſon, and much more Chriſtian Humility teaches us to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our own private underſtanding: which cannot give us ſuch aſſurance that a thing is good, and wholeſome, and neceſſary for us, as the Univerſal opinion of all our Brethren about it, doth work in us. Which is one advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of joyning in publick Prayers, wherein all agree: as being formed by the publick judgment of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, and accepted by the generality of God's people, and found by long obſervation, to contain nothing; but what is fit to be askt of the Almighty Goodneſs.</p>

There are ſome things indeed, which every one may be aſſured, are undoubtedly according to God's will; and there are thoſe who fancy that Authorized Prayers may as well be put up to God at home, as in the Church. But it is further to be conſidered, that the united force of a great many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who joyn in a Petition, is far ſtronger and more prevalent, than the addreſs of a ſingle Supplicant.

               </p>
               <p n="3">III. But further we are to conſider, how much our Zeal and Devotion is naturally inflamed, by Publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: which is a thing of great power in Prayer. For it is that which the Apoſtle calls <hi>praying in the Spirit,</hi> and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:179513:70"/>
                  <hi>praying in the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> with fervent, that is, and inflamed deſires; ſuch as the Holy Ghoſt excites, when it is pleaſed to breath upon our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Now this, as I ſaid, is even natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtirred up, by the fervour of thoſe Devout Worſhippers, with whom we joyn our Petitions. For who can ſee a great many good people fall down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and kneel before the Lord their Maker, with hands and eyes lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to Heaven, imploring his Grace and Mercy (which are things ſuppoſed in Chriſtian Aſſemblies) and not be thereby put in mind, that it is a matter of great concernment, about which they are ſo earneſt? Nay, be mightily mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to proſtrate himſelf in like manner, to Worſhip the great Lord of all, and to make him the ſame acknowedgments; which are as much due from him as from any body elſe in the World?</p>
               <p>Were a man never ſo dull, or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Religious Worſhip, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but he ſhould be in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure affected; when he comes among a multitude whoſe reverend and ferious behaviour in the Divine ſervice, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the inward reſpect they have in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:179513:70"/>their minds, unto that Almighty Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom they ſo devoutly Worſhip. It would certainly not only put him in mind of his Duty; but incline him, with the like ſigns of humble and hearty Devotion, to caſt down him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in his Bleſſed Preſence.</p>
               <p>And the greater ſigns of ardency of deſire, and warmth of affection, there appears in thoſe with whom we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, the more feeling we ſhall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally have of it our ſelves: it being impoſſible to be quite cold by the fire ſide; and to have no touch of Zeal, when we are in the company of thoſe, who manifeſt a vigorous flame of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love in their hearts.</p>
               <p>Beſides, It is a comfortable ſight barely to behold a great company ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, to own one and the ſame Father; who therefore cannot but look upon one another as Brethren. This is St. <hi>Hierome</hi>'s obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>in</hi> iv. <hi>Galat.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Major laetitiaex mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo conſpectu oritur,</hi> the greater joy ariſes in every heart, by the very mutual ſight of each other. For ſo it is when Friends meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they rejoyce to ſee the Faces one
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:179513:71"/>of another; they bleſs the occaſion that brought them into one and the ſame place: and the more there are of them, the greater rejoycing is there among them.</p>
               <p>Now joy inlarges the heart, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates our Spirits; it makes them ſpread ſo much, that ſometime we can ſcarce contain them, but are tranſported be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our ſelves. As on the contrary, ſorrow and ſadneſs contracts and ſhrinks up the Spirits; flats and deadens them ſo much, that we have ſcarce any life left in us. Upon which account the Spiritual joy and gladneſs I ſpoke of, ariſing from the ſight of ſo many Chriſtian Neighbours and Friends, is a very great help to us in our Devotion; making us to pour out our Souls, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, with the more inlarged deſire. It is but a dull and melancholy thing to be alone; in compariſon with the chearfulneſs, which a great company, of the ſame mind and Spirit, naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in each others Breaſts.</p>
               <p>By which we may underſtand alſo the advantage of full Aſſemblies, in our Churches: which look more love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:179513:71"/>and therefore quicken more than a thin, ſcattered Congregation. Which is a damp to Chriſtian Spirits; becauſe it is a very ſad ſight to behold the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service neglected: as it is, where there are but few that come together, to do God honour.</p>
               <p>The ſumm of this Argument is, That as no man is ſo warm alone, as in a crowd: So our Spiritual fervour is more quickned in an Aſſembly of pious Worſhippers, than it is apt to be, when we are retired by our ſelves. Where we ought indeed to awaken our Thoughts, and ſtir up our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but it muſt be acknowledged that we want then a great help and ſpurr thereunto; which is the Holy Zeal of thoſe who joyn with us in the ſame Petitions, in the Publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: eſpecially the ſeriouſneſs, the gravity, and earneſtneſs of him, who miniſters the ſervice of God there: Which together with the Authority of his Office, the Sacredneſs and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtickneſs ſometime of the place, ſet apart intirely for ſuch ſervices, is apt to raiſe in us more ardent Devotion, than we can eaſily raiſe in our ſelves alone.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:179513:72"/>
               <p n="4">IV. But if we had the ſame advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of this kind when we are alone (which we have not) yet there is one more, which wholly ariſes from our frequenting the Publick Aſſemblies. And that is the good example we give to others; who may be hereby moved to become Religious.</p>
               <p>What we do alone, no body ſees; nor is it intended that they ſhould: but rather that it ſhould be kept ſecret. And therefore it can be no inducement unto others to do their Duty; but is the bare diſcharge of our own. For which cauſe it is the leſs valuable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth leſs good: for that is the beſt thing, which doth the moſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal good. By which meaſure, if we judge of Prayer, we muſt prefer the publick; whereby others are put in mind of their Duty; nay attracted to it by our example: whereas we our ſelves alone are profited by what we do alone.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid indeed that we do good to others by praying for them. But this is a very ſmall good in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon; becauſe it is more than they know: and while we neglect the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:179513:72"/>ſervice, we do them more miſchief, than we can be ſuppoſed to do them good, by our private Prayers. For we bring Religion into contempt, when it hath few or none that attend the publick Offices of it: and we let them want, as I ſaid, the force of Example, to awaken them out of that careleſs neglect of God, which is too common in the World.</p>
               <p>This is an Argument that ſhould prevail very much with all good minds, both to frequent the Publick Service of God, and to behave themſelves with an awful reverence therein. Which will have ſome effect upon the looſer ſort; who now are hardned in their impiety, by the emptineſs of our Churches at the time of ſolemn Worſhip, or by the negligence of their behaviour, who vouchſafe to attend upon it. A multitude ſwayes very much either way; to incline men to be good, as well as to be bad. It is hard to reſiſt numerous examples. They are able to bring Devotion, as well as other things in faſhion.</p>
               <p>But if our example have not this effect on others, we have notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:179513:73"/>done the beſt we could to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the ſervice of God in the World: which will be a great comfort to us at preſent, and turn to our good account hereafter. We have let our light ſhine before men; we have teſtified openly to the truth of Religion; we have expreſſed our affection to it, and reproved the impiety of thoſe who regard not God: Yea, we put a ſtop to the progreſs of this impiety; we hinder its growth and increaſe, by wreſting a great Argument out of their hands againſt Religion: which is, that there are few who are Religious.</p>
               <p>If that then be good for us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we do the moſt good to others, which is an undoubted truth, we ought to be moſt in love with the publick Prayers. That we may invite others, by our conſtant attendance on them, to joyn with us in giving God the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that is due unto him, and free our ſelves from the guilt of other mens ſins, which we draw upon our ſelves, when by giving little or no publick ſign of our Devotion, we tempt them to become or continue irreligious. For, as by performing our Duty alone by
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:179513:73"/>our ſelves, we do only ourſelves good; but profit not others; who receive great benefit by our Publick Devotion: ſo, if we ſhould at any time neglect our Duty alone, we thereby hurt only our ſelves; but by neglecting the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service of God, we hurt all that are near us by our pernitious Example: tempting them to think that Religion is only a private fancy, which ſome men have taken up, without any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for were it a reality, all men would be concerned to maintain and uphold it, the beſt they can, in the World.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given an Account of the firſt Argument for the neceſſity of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers; taken from the Nature of Prayer it ſelf: both as it reſpects God, and our ſelves. By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that all thoſe motives which I uſed in the firſt part of this Book to perſwade us to Prayer in general; are moſt efficacious to draw us to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip of God. There being no greater Honour, than to be known to be the Servants of the moſt High: by attending upon whoſe Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice our minds are inlarged, unto great
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:179513:74"/>and worthy thoughts of God; and our affections ſtirred up to the higheſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of him, and love to him, who provides for ſo many as there wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, nay, diſpenſes his Bleſſings to the whole Univerſe, which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto him. Whereby our hope and confidence in him is alſo exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advanced, though we had never ſuch great things to ask of him: having the united force alſo of a great many Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners to ſtrengthen it; who joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to ſolicite his favour. Which there likewiſe we are naturally inclined to ſeek in the moſt ſerious, and the moſt compoſed manner; it being a ſhame not to frame our ſelves, when we appear publickly upon ſuch a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty buſineſs; unto the moſt reverend de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment: which I have ſhown, is of it ſelf alone a ſingular benefit we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by Prayer to God. The ſenſe of whom, is the guide of our Life, and the ſtay of our heart: which is both upheld, and raiſed to the higheſt degree by his Publick Worſhip. Whereby, if we do not prevail for all thoſe, whoſe welfare and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we ſeek; we maintain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:179513:74"/>notwithſtanding in our own minds a lively ſenſe, an high eſteem of thoſe Graces and Bleſſings, which we earneſtly deſire and ask for all Mankind. For whoſe good as we ought to be concerned; ſo we are made more ſenſible of it, more affected with it, and ſolicitous for it by the publick Service of God, than we are inclined to be in our private Devotions. This will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the management of the <hi>ſecond</hi> general argument, propounded in the beginning of this Diſcourſe: for which I deſign the next Chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Publick Prayers moſt ſutable to the Nature of Man.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Proceed now to conſider the Nature of Man, as I have done the Nature of Prayer; from whence we ſhall more fully learn the neceſſity of God's Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervice; and that it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all other.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:179513:75"/>
               <p>Prayer being a natural Duty (as I have proved in the beginning) ariſing from the neceſſity of our own being, which is precarious and dependent on another; who ought therefore to be continually acknowledged by us: it will eaſily appear from thence, that it ought to be publick, and not only alone by our ſelves; becauſe Nature hath formed us to ſociety, without which we cannot be preſerved in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. From whence innumerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be deduced for our publick Aſſembling together, conſtantly to Worſhip that Almighty Being: who hath thus, by the very Laws of our Creation, diſpoſed us to joyn together for our common preſervation. For,</p>
               <p n="1">I. We cannot but ſee, at the very firſt mention of this, that we being made to have ſociety one with another, ſhould above all things, have ſociety in Prayer to him that made us; and continually maintains and preſerves us.</p>
               <p>For what can be more abſurd than to have ſociety in the lowect actions of humane Life; and not in the higheſt: which are of principal concern to us, for our conſervation? It is ſuch an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:179513:75"/>as if we ſhould joyn together to ſave one anothers houſes: but not to ſave one anothers lives. And yet there is far leſs difference between a building of Wood or Stone, and this excellent ſtructure of our Body; than there is between our worldly affairs, and thoſe of our immortal Souls. Which teach us, at the firſt thought of ſuch things, that if we were made to live together in ſociety, and not alone; it is a juſt reaſon that God ſhould be acknowledged by us all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is the founder of ſociety: and as we tranſact all our common concerns together, by meeting in a Body; ſo the buſineſs of Religion eſpecially (which is the cement of Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and the Fountain of all Juſtice and Charity) ſhould be thus tranſacted, and we ſhould with a common conſent meet together in one place, to adore and acknowledge Him: which is the greateſt concern we have in this World, even for this reaſon; becauſe it ſupports, as you have heard, a ſenſe of him, without which all ſociety will be diſſolved.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:179513:76"/>
               <p n="2">II. And there is the greater reaſon for this, becauſe men are the only Creatures here, that are indued with a ſenſe of God and of Religion: and therefore ſhould above all things joyn in that, and ſtudy to promote it, which is moſt proper to them, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes them more than any thing elſe, from the Brutes. In whom we ſee ſome faint imitation of Reaſon and Diſcourſe, but not the leaſt ſign of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Which may well be look't upon as the diſcriminating property in man; and make us think that he may be better defined, a <hi>Religious,</hi> than a <hi>Rational Creature.</hi> This, at leaſt, ſhould be joyned with the other, and he defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; <hi>a rational Religious Creature.</hi> For all definitions are taken from that, which moſt peculiarly belongs to every Being: and there is nothing ſo pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to us, as a ſenſe of Religion. Which if we do not exerciſe together, we do not act like men; who in all reaſon, ſhould joyn to maintain and promote that which is moſt proper to them (<hi>viz.</hi> Religion) more than any thing elſe in the World.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:179513:76"/>
               <p>For which end God hath given to us alone the gift of Speech, which no other Creatures have beſides our ſelves; that we ſhould proclaim his Praiſes, and make it known that we honour him, and excite one another to the love of him, the Supream Being. Who needs no words to tell him our thoughts; but is acquainted with the very beginning of them, before they are formed: and therefore hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us the faculty of ſpeaking, that we may tell our thoughts unto others, and make them underſtand that we are Religiouſly affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. Who, if he had intended Religion ſhould be only a private buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, might have made us without Tongues, becauſe he needs no Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to acquaint him with our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; but hears our very thoughts, and perceives the moſt inward moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Souls. VVhich we have power to expreſs in words, not that he may underſtand us; but for the benefit of others, that they may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand our ſenſe, and know that we are lovers of God, and be ſtirred up by our Prayers, and Praiſes, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:179513:77"/>Thankſgivings, to the ſame Devotion towards him. Whence <hi>David</hi> calls his Tongue <hi>his glory</hi> (lvii. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.) becauſe therewith he glorified God: and, as it there follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Praiſed God among the people, and ſung unto him among the Nations</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This St <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſes, when he ſaith Prayers ought not to be made in an unknown Tongue, becauſe if they were, he that was not learned in that Tongue, would not be able to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> xiv. 16. which word, <hi>Amen,</hi> was then it ſeems pronounced, at the end of every Prayer, by the whole company: for whom, the publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſpake to God, and was as it were, their mouth, in what he ſaid. But though it was thus ordered to avoid confuſion, and that it might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly known by every body, what was ſaid in the Church (which had been impoſſible, if they had all ſpoken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) yet they thought themſelves bound to ſignifie and declare that he ſpake their ſenſe; by ſaying, <hi>Amen,</hi> at the concluſion of the Prayer he made. Which was as much in effect, as if they had ſaid every word of it themſelves:
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:179513:77"/>for it was as much as to ſay, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, and conſented to the whole. And this every one did ſo audibly; that a great multitude being gathered together in a Church, it imitated the voice of Thunder; as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> tells us.</p>
               <p>And, verily, it is a great fault that we do not all thus joyn in the Publick Prayers at this day; not only by our bodily preſence, but with our tongues: which ought to expreſs our conſent to thoſe Petitions and Thankſgivings, which are offered up to God in the name of us all.</p>
               <p n="3">III. And there is a further reaſon for common Prayer; be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               <p>Which is the meaning of the Holy <hi>Pſlamiſt,</hi> when he calls upon all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Heaven and in Earth, both vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and inviſible, to praiſe the Lord. <hi>Pſal.</hi> cxlviii. That is, he excites him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others, to give God Thanks for them; and to acknowledge the Praiſes which they continually give him: His moſt Glorious perfections, that is, which they declare and ſet forth, in the moſt publick manner.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:179513:79"/>For they ſpeak to all, as much as they do to one, the moſt excellent, immenſe greatneſs, and goodneſs of the Lord; who in Wiſdom alſo hath made them all: and this we ought as publickly to declare; it being all that we can do for the Honour of his Name, but only live accordingly: which this alſo teaches us, and makes abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that we may eternally praiſe him.</p>

For ſo you may obſerve that the Apoſtle directing the Service of the Church, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 1, 2. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in the very firſt place, That <hi>Prayers, Supplications, Interceſſions, and Thanksgivings be made for all Men, for Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he knew was of greater concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the good of the World, than to have Governours, whom he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where calls the <hi>Miniſters of God,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in their juſt Authority: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be bleſſed with good Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:179513:81"/>who might be conſervators of Peace and Quietneſs, puniſhers of Vice and Wickedneſs, a terrour to evil doers, and incouragers of thoſe that do well. And therefore he ordains that this great thing ſhould be askt of God, by Publick Prayers: becauſe it was of univerſal concernment, and of higheſt moment to every mans happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which ought to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any particular reſpects, unto which their Petitions might be directed.</p>
               <p>Agreeable to this I find in <hi>Joſephus;</hi> that the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> lookt upon it as their Duty, when they offered Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto God, to pray in the firſt place,

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:179513:81"/>
                  <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and we may add to it,

                     <hi>L.</hi> viii. <hi>de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. Evang. Sect.</hi> 8.</note> what the Hebrew Doctors now tell us in their Books; that the laſt thing, the High Prieſt prayed for on the great day of Expiation, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came out of the Holy Place, was this: That <hi>God would not hear the Prayers of thoſe,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P. Fagius in Levit.</hi> xvi. 17.</note> who were in a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:</hi> that is, Prayers made for mens own private benefit, againſt the Publick Intereſt; ſuch as the Prayers of thoſe in a Journey are wont to be, who deſire fair Weather, when all the Country prays for Rain.</p>
               <p>But howſoever this was; it is plain by the Apoſtles words, that he would have thoſe things principally askt of God, which related to the community: which ought therefore to be ſought by their common Prayers and Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And ſo they were Anciently in the Chriſtian Church, as we find in <hi>Tertullian;</hi> (to name no other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) who deſcribing the Chriſtian Aſſemblies, ſaith, <hi>We pray there for the Emperors, and for their Miniſters, and for Powers, and for the State of the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:179513:82"/>World, for the quiet of things,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apolog. Cap.</hi> 39.</note> and for the delay of the end of the World.</hi> Which he had declared before more largely, <hi>We pray to the Eternal God, for the health and ſafety of the Emperors, to the true God, the living God, who made them Emperors, and whom it concerns the Emperours, above all things, to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To him we look up,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ib. Cap.</hi> 30.</note> and all of us pray alwayes for them, that they may have a long Life, a ſecure Empire, a ſafe Family, a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Army, a faithful Senate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This was ſo known a practice, and it was ſo firmly believed in thoſe dayes, that the Peace and Safety, the Honour, and Proſperity of Kings and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, depended very much upon the due performance of this dayly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; that there are examples of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Princes, who had ſo much Faith, as to deſire to have their ſafety com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto God in the Prayers of the Church. Which were inſtituted with ſuch a peculiar reſpect, (it appears by St. <hi>Paul</hi>) to the welfare of Princes, the ſupport of their Government, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:179513:82"/>the proſperity of their people; that they cannot be neglected, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering the good eſtate of the World. And may poſſibly be one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the World hath been ſo full of diſorder and confuſion; becauſe Chriſtian people have not applyed themſelves earneſtly enough, in dayly Publick Prayers (which are generally diſregarded) to beſeech God for the publick good and tranquillity, but are wholly bent to the fulfilling of their own private deſires.</p>
               <p n="5">V. And as we ought thus to joyn in Prayer, that we may recommend our common concerns, to the care of Almighty Wiſdom and Goodneſs; ſo likewiſe, that we may, by the common Offices of Religion, keep our ſelves the cloſer knit together, in firm Love and Unity; in the ſame ſociety. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing combines men ſo ſtrongly, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: and the purer it is, the greater effect it hath for the ſtay and ſupport of the Commonwealth. Which hath made all Law-givers (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in his Politicks) to exerciſe their firſt care about Religion: becauſe it is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:179513:83"/>that which qualifies all ſorts of men to be ſerviceable to the Publick; making Governours (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> I think ſpeaks) apter to rule with Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and Inferiours, for Conſcience ſake, willingly to obey their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
               <p>It was an admirable ſaying of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> in his Diſcourſe againſt an Epicurean;
<note n="*" place="margin">Adverſ. Coloten.</note> That <hi>a City may as well be built in the Air, without any Earth to ſtand upon; as a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth or Kingdom be either conſtituted or conſerved, without the ſupport of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> Take this away, and you take away the Foundation on which the Kingdom is laid: and it can neither be erected, or being erected cannot ſtand, when this is gone. Now as Religion is neceſſary to uphold States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, ſo the Publick exerciſe of it, is as neceſſary to uphold Religion. Let the Publick Aſſemblies ceaſe, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will not long ſtand. But we ſhall ſoon loſe it, if we do not meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to joyn in the common Offices of it: and we ſhall ſoon be tempted to have the leſs concern for one anothers
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:179513:83"/>ſafety and happineſs, when we are not tied together by the bond of one and the ſame Religion. In which when we heartily joyn to ſerve God, it makes us look upon one another as Brethren; dear to the ſame God and Father of us all, and therefore dear to one another.</p>
               <p>This the Pſalmiſt repreſents, when he cryes out in the beginning of cxxxiii. Pſal. <hi>Behold, how good, and how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity.</hi> He would have all the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites to</hi> look upon themſelves as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; being all deſcended from one and the ſame ſtock, and having alſo the ſame God for their Father. And then they <hi>dwelt together in unity,</hi> not merely when they lived lovingly, and unanimouſly purſued the ſame common Intereſt, for the common good; but then eſpecially when they all met in one and the ſame place, to Worſhip God together, with one heart, and with one Soul: which linkt them cloſer than any other bond could do, and provided beſt for their common ſecurity. For it appears by what follows, he chiefly aims at this aſſembling themſelves una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly together; as the words are
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:179513:84"/>in the Hebrew, <hi>O how good and pleaſant is it, for Brethren to dwell, even toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: i. e.</hi> to meet all at God's houſe, as common to them all. Nothing more delightful, than to behold ſuch a general Aſſembly: which he illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates by two ſimilitudes. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of the pretious Oyntment which ran down from the Head of the High Prieſt, to the very skirt of his Garment: And then by the Dew of Heaven, which made the Hill of <hi>Hermon,</hi> and the Mountain of <hi>Zion</hi> (nigh to which the Temple ſtood) exceeding fruitful. And then in concluſion he adds the reaſon, why this was ſo joyful a ſight, and ſo beneficial: <hi>for there the Lord command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Bleſſing, even Life for ever more.</hi> He pours down his Bleſſings of all ſorts, (as the Heavens do the Dew, and as the pretious Oyntment ran down from <hi>Aaron</hi>'s head) upon a people that are thus unanimouſly joyned together, in the Worſhip and Service of God: who only can make them happy (that's meant by <hi>Life</hi>) and can make them ſo for evermore</p>
               <p>In order to which, He took care his Divine Service ſhould be perpetually
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:179513:84"/>performed in the Temple; whither they were to reſort, to do their Duty to him, and to implore his Grace and Favour towards them. And I cannot think it fell out by chance, that next to the <hi>Pſalm</hi> now mentioned, is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately placed a ſolemn Exhortation (in the cxxxiv. <hi>Pſ.</hi>) unto the Miniſters of God, to attend conſtantly upon their Duty in the Sanctuary; there to praiſe the Lord, who made Heaven and Earth: and to give a Bleſſing to his people, and pray for their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, out of <hi>Sion,</hi> as that Pſalm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes.</p>
               <p>I end this with the obſervation of a wiſe man; that we being Members of a publick Body, ought to ſerve it the beſt we can. Now all the Service we do, as Members of it, is publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: which is far more worthy, than what we act for our ſelves privately and diſtinctly; as much as a whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety exceeds the worth of any one Man in it. And what ſervice is there we can do it, like to that, of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's true Religion; by ſerious attendance, with due care and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, upon the publick Offices thereof.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:179513:85"/>whereby we ſhall exceedingly promote the common good of all; and maintain Society it ſelf: by which we are kept and preſerved in ſafety and proſperity.</p>
               <p>For by doing publick honour to God, we ſhall draw down publick Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings upon our ſelves. God himſelf will bleſs us, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>He will bleſs them that fear the Lord, both ſmall and great. The Lord ſhall increaſe you more and more, you and your Children: Ye are the Bleſſed of the Lord, that made Heaven and Earth</hi> CXV. Pſal. 13, 14, 15. Obſerve the Title he gives himſelf, <hi>The Lord that made Heaven and Earth;</hi> and you will not think it ſutable to his ſuper-excellent and tranſcendent Majeſty, to have his Worſhip confined to your Cloſets, or to your private Houſes; but make it as publick as the Heaven and the Earth are, which are expoſed to the view of all. In that ſpatious Temple of his (as the Ancients were wont to call the World, of which the Temple at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> was an imitation) he is to be magnified, and praiſed as openly, and with as great multitudes, as can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly meet together: that we may not
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:179513:85"/>ſeem to Worſhip ſome little, petty Deity, but the Univerſal Lord of all.</p>
               <p>Thus I am faln upon the Argument wherewith I begun, which cannot be too often preſſed: and hath a cloſe connexion with this other, which I have now handled. For he having formed us to live together in Society, and to keep cloſely United in one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for our common ſafety and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; teaches us thereby to own Him as the common Parent of us all: and to contrive the beſt wayes we can, whereby we may acknowledge him ſo to be. And there is no way like this, of meeting together in the greateſt multitude that can aſſemble, to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and praiſe Him with one voice for his Goodneſs; and declaring the Wonders he doth for the Children of Men, commend our ſelves and all our concerns, unto his moſt powerful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. <hi>By whom Kings Raign, and Princes decree Juſtice:</hi> and therefore he ought to be ſought for their Guidance and Direction, Protection and Safety; and to be acknowledged, as it is in the <hi>Collect</hi> for our King, to be the <hi>High and Mighty, King of kings, Lord of lords,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:179513:86"/>the only Ruler of Princes; who from his Throne beholds all that dwell on the Earth.</hi> And they are all (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet moſt admirably expreſſes it) <hi>as Nothing, leſs than Nothing and Vanity;</hi> in compariſon with his incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Greatneſs: Who, as that great King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> publickly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and deſired all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Kingdoms ſhould take notice of it, is, the <hi>High God whoſe Kingdom is an Everlaſting Kingdom, and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is from Generation to Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So he begins the Proclamation he cauſed to be made, of his humble De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to the Divine Majeſty: by whom he had been abaſed, as low as the Beaſts of the Earth <hi>Dan.</hi> iv. 2, 3. After which he tells all the World, <hi>I Bleſſed the Moſt High, and I Praiſed and Honoured Him that liveth for ever, whoſe Dominion is an Everlaſting Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and his Kingdom is from Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Generation. And all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Earth are reputed as No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: and he doth according to his Will, in the Army of Heaven, and among
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:179513:86"/>the Inhabitants of the Earth: and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, what doſt thou?</hi> ver. 34, 35. And then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his Declaration in this manner; <hi>Now I Nebuchadnezzar Praiſe, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol, and Honour the King of Heaven: all whoſe works are Truth, and his wayes Judgment; and thoſe that walk in Pride, he is able to abaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Voice worthy of a King; and worthy to be publiſhed throughout all the World: and therefore he made the <hi>Declaration,</hi> wherein it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, to be ſent to <hi>all People, Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Languages, that dwelt on all the Earth,</hi> ver. 1. that is, throughout all his wide Empire; to all the parts of the Earth where his Authority reached, and his words would be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced; that they might magnifie this great King of Heaven and Earth, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him.</p>
               <p>That was the end of it; and it is one of the moſt publick pieces of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we ever read was performed by any man; ariſing out of this ſenſe, with which he was poſſeſſed in thoſe Ancient times, that God is to be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:179513:87"/>Bleſſed, and Extolled publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, among, and by all People: to whom he thought himſelf bound to ſhow, the Signs and the Wonders, which the moſt High God had wrought towards him. And, <hi>How great,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are his Signs, and how mighty are his Wonders?</hi> ver. 3. He was not able to tell; but made the beſt, and the moſt ample Declaration of them, that he could; in this Imperial Decree, which he cauſed to be proclaimed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where.</p>
               <p>By all which we may eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, in what groſs Errors two ſorts of people live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> They who imagine, that God may be ſerved as well at home, as at the Church. Such men neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Nature of God, nor the Nature of Religion, nor their own Nature: which teach them quite otherwiſe. And inſtruct them alſo to frequent the Publick Aſſemblies, where they have opportunity ſo to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For that is another pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Error, to think that it is ſufficient if we come on the Lord's
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:179513:87"/>Day to teſtifie that we do not forget God: though all the Week beſide, we take no notice of him; but conſtantly neglect his Publick Service, when we are invited to it, and have leiſure to attend it. We forget the many pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, common Bleſſings we dayly need, and dayly receive; which ought to be as publickly every day implored and acknowledged, in our Common Prayers.</p>
               <p>Let the foregoing conſiderations be duly pondered, and they will perſwade you, both out of Love to God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and out of love to your own good, to joyn, as often as you can, your Prayers, Praiſes, and Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, with the whole Church of God: and to make our Aſſemblies as full as you can, both on the Lord's Day, and every Day of the Week.

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>The Nature of a Church requires there ſhould be Publick Prayers.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Proceed now to the <hi>Third</hi> Head of Arguments, whereby a Chriſtian ſhould be moſt of all moved to his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and that is, to conſider the Nature of the Church; which both requires Publick Aſſemblies, and makes the Service performed in them far more acceptable than Private Prayers can be.</p>
               <p>And here let it be conſidered in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that the very word we tranſlate <hi>Church,</hi> in the Holy Scriptures, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:179513:88"/>in the <hi>Greek</hi> Language, an <hi>Aſſembly;</hi> a company of perſons met together, and that publickly, upon the publick buſineſs, or occaſions. The firſt time but one, we meet with this Word in the New Teſtament, it is uſed in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to a ſingle perſon, alone by himſelf; or to one or two more beſide him. Matth. xviii. 15, 16, 17. <hi>If thy Brother treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault, between thee and him alone, and if he will not hear thee, take one or two more,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and if he neglect to hear them, tell it to the Church:</hi> that is, to that ſolemn Aſſembly which ſat to judge cauſes, and unto which was the laſt reſort: ſo that, if he did not hear them, he was to be lookt upon <hi>as an Heathen Man and a Publican.</hi> And, the truth is, it ſignifies any ſort of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> or concourſe of People; which was among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews.</hi> For in the xix. of the <hi>Acts;</hi> when all the City of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was in an uproar, and ran together into the Theatre, crying up <hi>Diana,</hi> this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concourſe is thrice called their <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:179513:89"/>(<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>was confuſed,</hi> &amp;c. and ver. 39. If you inquire of other matters it ſhall be determined, <hi>in a lawful Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 41. having thus ſpoken, <hi>he diſmiſſed the Aſſembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this being the very Notion of the word <hi>Church;</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> which Chriſt hath called, is an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Men and Women met together to Worſhip God by him, to give him Thanks for all his Benefits, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his Grace and Mercy to them and to all the World. It is an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly or Company of Men, as much as any other; but our Saviour's Kingdom being not of this World, the Aſſembly which he appoints, is not to meet for Civil Ends and Purpoſes, but for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. And the great thing in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is the Devout Worſhip of God, and giving Him the Honour due unto his Name: for which the <hi>Church, i.e.</hi> Chriſtian Aſſemblies being founded, it is a clear demonſtration that this Worſhip, is not ſo well performed alone by our ſelves, as in theſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. For here we act moſt like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; that is, like Members of the Body of Chriſt, which is his Church.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:179513:89"/>With which whoſoever doth not joyn, he is no longer a Chriſtian, becauſe he is not a Member of the Body of Chriſt: which is a Company joyned together, to have Fellowſhip with God and one with another, in all Holy Duties; of which Prayer, Thankſgiving, and Praiſes are the chief. For though there they receive Chriſtian Inſtruction; yet that is not the principal buſineſs for which they aſſemble; as appears by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words to <hi>Timothy</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 1.</p>

Who if they did unanimouſly agree in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Petitions, our Saviour promiſes, ſhould find, notwithſtanding their ſmall number, that he would be <hi>preſent</hi> among them.</p>
               <p>That's the Bleſſing promiſed to their conſent and agreement in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer. Which is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as if he would not be preſent with a good Chriſtian, when he prays alone: but the meaning is, that then, when they joyned in common Prayer, he would be more eſpecially preſent. For if our Lord Chriſt have a love to every Chriſtian Soul, and delights to have its company: then is he much more pleaſed with a great number of them, who preſent themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſeek his Grace and Favour.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:179513:93"/>They are more welcome to him; their company is more lovely, the ſight of them more amiable; and they are more beloved of him, and prevail for greater Tokens of his love.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And here it may not be unfit to note, for a fuller explication of this matter; that the greateſt Bleſſings have then been beſtowed, when God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were at their Publick Prayers: which is a mighty Argument to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent them, in hope then to prevail far more, than we can in our private

Why did it come at this time rather than any other, but to honour the Publick Prayers and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; and to let them know what great benefits they might receive thereby, if devoutly attended.</p>
               <p>And when there could be no Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies at the Temple, in the time of their captivity, yet they praying then, privately with reſpect to it, as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Church; God was pleaſed to anſwer their Petitions, at that very hour, when Publick Prayers had been wont to be made at that place.

And the tydings he brought him, were the moſt joyful that ever had been heard; for they were the very ſame, which the ſame Angel afterwards brought to the Bleſſed Virgin, concerning the Birth of our Lord Chriſt, to lay down his Life for us.</p>
               <p>And in the New Teſtament, you may obſerve, God ſent his Angel to bring St. <hi>Peter</hi> out of Priſon, after a miraculous manner, delivering him out of the hand of <hi>Herod,</hi> and from all the expectation of the people of the <hi>Jews; while many were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther praying,</hi> Act. xii. 12. We read in the 5. <hi>ver.</hi> that <hi>prayer was made without ceaſing</hi> (or inſtant and earneſt Prayer was made) <hi>of the Church unto God for him:</hi> and in the very time when many, that is, the whole Church were gathered together, that is, in the time of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, God ſent Salvation to him. Upon which words St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> occaſionally reflecting, cryes out; <q>if
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:179513:94"/>the Prayer of the Church was ſo avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for <hi>Peter;</hi> if it reſcued him out of Priſon who was a Pillar of the Church; how comes it about, that thou haſt no ſenſe of its Power, but deſpiſeſt it, and ſetteſt it at nought by thy neglect of it?

O ſayes one, I can pray at home; but I can hear Sermons no where but in the Church. Vain Man! thou deceiveſt thy ſelf. Thou canſt indeed pray at home; but thou canſt not pray ſo, as thou doſt in the Church: where there is ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Fathers; where a cry is ſent up to God with one accord. Thou wilt not have ſuch audience, when thou beſeecheſt the Lord, by thy ſelf; as when thou prayeſt with thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. For there is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in this; <hi>viz.</hi> the Concord, the Conſpiration, and Harmony of many in the ſame Petition; the Bond of Charity; and the Prayers of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:179513:95"/>Prieſts: for therefore the Prieſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in thoſe Aſſemblies, that the Prayers of the Multitude which are weaker, may by the help of theirs which are ſtronger, go together with them into Heaven. Add to this; what good doth a Sermon do, when Prayer is not yoked with it? Firſt Prayer, and then the Word, as the Apoſtles ſay, <hi>Act.</hi> vi. 4. <hi>We will give our ſelves continually to Prayer, and to the Miniſtry of the Word.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, praying in the Preface to his Epiſtles, that the light of Prayer, like a torch, may uſher in the Word. And if thou didſt accuſtom thy ſelf to pray with exact diligence, thou wouldſt leſs need the Inſtructions of thy fellow Servant, God himſelf il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminating thy mind, without his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. And if thou thinkeſt thy Prayer alone to be of ſuch force; how powerful muſt it be, when joyned with a multitude? This is far more nervous; and there is greater confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and aſſurance in it, than in that which is made at home, and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.

               <p n="3">III. THE next thing I obſerve is, that according to the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Saviour, and the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement he had given them, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his Bleſſed Preſence among them; the Apoſtles and the reſt of Chriſt's Diſciples, immediately upon their Maſters aſcenſion unto Heaven, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelves together, for common Prayer and Supplication. For ſo we read in the <hi>Act.</hi> i. 12, &amp;c. that as ſoon as he was gone out of their ſight, and the Angels had told them whither he was gone, <hi>They returned unto Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:179513:96"/>and when they were come in, they went up into an upper Room</hi> (the place, as ſhall be ſhown preſently, of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Worſhip) <hi>and all continued with one accord in Prayer and Supplication, with the Women, and Mary, the Mother of Jeſus, and with his Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was in their Aſſemblies, we read in St. <hi>John,</hi> where our Saviour often appeared to them, preſently after his Reſurrection, <hi>Joh.</hi> xx. 19.26. and we may well think it was for Devotion that they aſſembled; for it was on the firſt day of the Week. But here we read expreſly, after he was aſcended into Heaven, what they did in thoſe Aſſemblies. In which there being, one day, an hundred and twenty met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they made ſolemn Prayer to God for direction in the choice of a new Apoſtle, to ſucceed in the room of <hi>Judas, Act.</hi> i. 15.24 But that which is moſt remarkable, you find in the beginning of the next Chapter; that when the day of Pentecoſt was fully come, <hi>they were all with one accord, in one place,</hi> and ſuddenly they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with Tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:179513:96"/>great gift, whereby they were to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Church in all Nations, as they had began to do at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and thereabouts, came down upon them, when they were all met together, for the Service of God. The <hi>one place</hi> here ſpoken of, being no other, than that mentioned before: where <hi>they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with one accord, in Prayer and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> The place where they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled immediately after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as I ſaid juſt now; and in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the place where our Lord eat his laſt Supper with them before his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They did not look for this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of our Saviour in their Cloſets; but expected he would be in the midſt of them, by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, when they were met together, to wait upon him for the fulfilling of his Word.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And accordingly you may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther note, that all they who were converted by them, to own Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus for their Lord and Maſter, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately joyned themſelves to them, to Worſhip God in communion with them. Thus you read, how upon that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:179513:97"/>very day, when they received the Holy Ghoſt, and preached thereupon unto all they could meet withal, the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>as many as received the Word</hi> (that is, believed on Chriſt) <hi>were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> (that was the firſt thing, they were admitted into the Church) and the effect of it was this. <hi>They continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and breaking of Bread, and in Prayers,</hi> ver. 41, 42. which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated again, <hi>ver.</hi> 46. <hi>they continued daily, with one accord, in the Temple</hi> (Worſhipping God with the <hi>Jews</hi>) and then <hi>received the Euchariſt at home:</hi> which was the proper Chriſtian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, wherein they joyned together in their own Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>And here it is very remarkable, that when their numbers were increaſed from <hi>three</hi> to <hi>five</hi> thouſand, and there was a new deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, to inable more beſides thoſe on whom it fell at firſt, to preach the Word; this deſcent was at the time of Prayer, when they were aſſembled together for that purpoſe. Read <hi>Act.</hi> iv. where you find, that the Apoſtles being let
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:179513:97"/>go, from their impriſonment, they went unto their own Company (<hi>ver.</hi> 23.) and reported all that the Chief Prieſts and Elders had ſaid unto them. Which when the Company heard, <hi>they lift up their voice to God, with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Lord, Thou art God which haſt made Heaven, and Earth, and the Sea, and all that in them is,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>grant unto thy Servants, that with all boldneſs they may ſpeak thy Word,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 24, 25, &amp;c. <hi>And when they had prayed</hi> (ver. 31.) <hi>the place was ſhaken where they were aſſembled together,</hi> (for Prayer you plainly ſee) <hi>and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and they ſpake the Word of God with boldneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as it was at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo in all other places where they ſetled a Church, it was for this purpoſe, that they ſhould aſſemble to Worſhip God together, by Chriſt Jeſus. This was the very firſt or principal thing they ordained in ſuch Churches; as thoſe words to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which I have often named, ſufficiently teſtifie 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii 1. <hi>I will therefore that firſt of all, Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks be made for all Men,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:179513:98"/>Which Aſſemblies the Apoſtles requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Chriſtians not to forſake, no not in times of danger, <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 25. For that (you may note as I paſs along) was to fall off from Chriſtianity, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the following Words, <hi>ver</hi> 26. For as to become a Chriſtian was to joyn themſelves, to the Chriſtian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, in ſuch actions of Religion (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that you read of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who being converted, <hi>aſſayed to joyn himſelf to the Brethren,</hi> that is, to the Aſſemblies of Chriſtians, <hi>Act.</hi> ix. 26.) So to ceaſe to be thus joyned in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Communion, was to ceaſe to be a Chriſtian; and, in effect, to deny <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt to be their Lord and Saviour: who hath made all that belong unto him, to be a Church; that is, as I have often ſaid, a Company of Men and Women, aſſembling themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Divine Offices.</p>
               <p n="5">V. And that they might ſo do, there was, it may further be obſerved, a certain place appointed for their Aſſemblies: becauſe there could be no Aſſemblies, but they muſt be held ſomewhere or other; and they could
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:179513:98"/>not be held with any certainty, unleſs the place were determined, and known to be deſigned for that purpoſe. Of this we read ſo frequently in the Holy Writings of the New Teſtament; that it is a wonder any ſhould make a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of it. I mentioned before the <hi>upper room, Act.</hi> i. 11. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles aſſembled, immediately after our Saviours Aſcenſion: which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Book</hi> ii. <hi>p.</hi> 408, &amp;c.</note> hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved to be the ſetled place of their Holy Aſſemblies. Where, as I ſaid, they were aſſembled again on the day of Pentecoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> ii. 1. and the next day after, iv. 31. and was the <hi>Houſe,</hi> where they are ſaid to have continued dayly breaking Bread at home, <hi>Act.</hi> ii. 46.</p>
               <p>Nor was this peculiar to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but in other Cities they had the like. For at <hi>Troas</hi> alſo the Church was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in an <hi>upper Chamber, Act.</hi> xx. 8. And at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi, 18, 20. the Apoſtle ſpeaks of their coming together, <hi>in the Church,</hi> and <hi>into one place:</hi> which he diſtinguiſhes from their own <hi>home,</hi> ver. 34. And again xiv. 23. he ſpeaks of the <hi>whole
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:179513:99"/>Church coming together into one place:</hi> Which was no other, but that place where they commonly aſſembled for Divine Worſhip. And ſo thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 8. <hi>I will therefore, that Men pray every where,</hi> &amp;c. Which is ſpoken, ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi> in oppoſition to aſſembling only at God's Houſe at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi> unto which men were no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger confined, but might aſſemble in any place, where there was a Houſe appointed for that purpoſe. So he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds thoſe words <hi>every where, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem locum ſacris coetibus deſtinatum</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place appointed, or ſet apart for Holy Aſſemblies to meet in: for St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaith he, ſpeaks of Publick Prayer, in the common Meeting.</p>
               <p>Thus St. <hi>Baſil</hi> many Ages before him explained the Apoſtles words,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>de Baptiſmo Reſp. ad Q.</hi> viii.</note> in anſwer to thoſe who urged them to prove that Prayer was not as well performed any where as the Church. <q>No ſuch matter, theſe words, <hi>in every place,</hi> do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſuch places as are imployed in common uſes, and in prophane, or
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:179513:99"/>perhaps filthy affairs, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but inlarges the Service of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Compaſs of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> unto any place in the World, which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prophecy about Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice) is reverently devoted unto God, for the Sacred performance of the Glorious Myſtery.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And that theſe places thus deſigned for Holy Aſſemblies, were ſeparated from common uſe, and ſet apart only for this; was never doubted till this laſt Age of fancy and vain conceit. Which hath imagined the ſeparation of places to Divine Service only, to be a meer legal Inſtitution: that is, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained merely by the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> which made the Tabernacle, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Temple, ſuch an Holy Place. Whereas they were ſo made, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the common Notions of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature: and only made more Holy and Separate than any other place, by the reſidence of a viſible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Glory there. Otherwiſe there were Holy, that is, ſeparated places, before that time (though not ſo Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or Holy as the Temple was) and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:179513:100"/>will be alwayes to the end of the World: unleſs we ſuppoſe that men will loſe all Reverence to God, and let him have nothing among us, which may be peculiarly called his own.</p>
               <p>Now this thing alone, is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Publick Worſhip, that there hath alwaies been a place appointed for Divine Service: which would have been needleſs, if Men were not bound to aſſemble together to Worſhip God; for then it might have been left to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones liberty, where they would pleaſe to do it themſelves.</p>
               <p>And this alſo ſhows the advantage, which Publick Worſhip hath of all other. For being performed in a place ſet a part for it, where nothing elſe is done, at our very entrance into it we are naturally put in mind of God, and of our buſineſs there; which is only with him: and ſo ſhall be more apt to be compoſed there, than in any other place; which we are wont to imploy about other things, beſides the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. Eſpecially, ſince all Wiſe Men have ever endeavoured, that the Service of God ſhould be there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, with the moſt Solemnity and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:179513:100"/>Majeſty that could be contrived; nay that the place it ſelf ſhould not be mean, but rather ſtately, and gravely adorned. For it is not with Publick Prayer, as it is with Private. <q>In Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> judiciouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) ſecrecy is commended, rather than outward ſhow: whereas Publick Prayer, being the act of the whole Society, requires accordingly more care to be had of external Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And therefore the very aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling of Men unto this Service, hath ever been very ſolemn; and the very outward Form of the place of Publick Prayer, hath been ever thought a Circumſtance of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to help Devotion.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI To this may be further added, from one of the Texts now mentioned, that the Apoſtle directs how they ſhould exerciſe their Spiritual Gifts, in the Holy place where they met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and particularly the Gift of Prayer, 1 <hi>Corinth</hi> xiv. 23.

               <p>And indeed that Spirit (it may be noted under this head) which inlivens the whole Body of the Church, moves every Member of it unto this, to joyn in its common Offices, for the Service of the whole. Which it is the very ſcope of the Apoſtle to demonſtrate, in thoſe three Chapters xii, xiii, xiv. of the Firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they ought in every thing to act as Members of a Body; ſeeking the improvement one of another, by the exerciſe of all their Gifts, not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately, but conjunctly, ſo that all might partake of the benefit. And whoſoever he is, that hath any ſenſe of ſuch a thing, as the Body of Chriſt, whereof he is one Member; he will never think that what he doth alone is as good as what he performs in Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, with the reſt of the Members. No, if he ſay the ſame Prayers, and offer the ſame Praiſes in private, which the Church offers in publick; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably think there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, nor imagine that both alike are God's Service: becauſe what he doth in conjunction with the reſt of the Body, is moſt agreeable to God's Holy
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:179513:103"/>Spirit; by which this Body is linkt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and every part of it moved to act for the good of the whole.</p>
               <p>I conclude this with the words of Mr. <hi>Thorndike;</hi> to imagine that Prayers at home will be as accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God,

               <p>This is another convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both that Chriſt deſigned pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies, becauſe he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed publick Miniſters to officiate there; and that the Prayers made there, are to be preferred before pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devotions, becauſe there we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Service of God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: the benefit whereof we loſe, if we content our ſelves with what we do at home.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more apparent in the Holy Writings, than that our Lord would have ſuch an order of men ſet apart, for his Divine Service in the Church.

               <p>For that praying for the People is a ſpecial part of their Work, we may learn from St. <hi>James</hi> v. 14. where he directs thoſe to whom he writes, when any Man was ſick, to <hi>ſend for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him.</hi> Which no leſs belonged to their Office, we may be ſure, when Men were well, than when they were ſick: being a part of their dayly miniſtration, for the whole Body of the Church. Whoſe weaker Prayers, as I noted before out of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> being helped by the ſtronger Prayers of God's Miniſters, go up to Heaven together with them.</p>
               <p>All Chriſtians indeed are called, <hi>A Holy and a Royal Prieſthood, to offer up Spiritual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 5, 9. but it is manifeſt by theſe very words, that they
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:179513:105"/>are not ſo ſingly, but in a Body: when they Pray and give Thanks, together with him that Miniſters the Divine Service in the Church, the <hi>Spiritual Houſe,</hi> of which the Apoſtle there ſpeaks; in which Spiritual Sacrifices were offered up to God. And ſince Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were offered only in Publick, in the place God appointed for them; we may thence, I think, conclude, that our Prayers, Praiſes, and Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings are then only Sacrifices, when made in our Aſſemblies: and that then we act as Prieſts unto God, and not at other times.</p>
               <p>The principal Sacrifice of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, I am ſure, is in its own Nature a Publick Service; and is to be ſo eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, even when it is adminiſtred to the Sick in Private; who receive it as part of that Body, which is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed continually to offer this Sacrifice. I mean the Holy Communion, wherein we offer to God, with Prayers, Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Thankſgivings, a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſs for us. For this we ought all to meet as frequently as we can; that we may conjunctly and openly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:179513:105"/>this benefit: becauſe, though this be the principal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate intention of this action, it hath reſpect alſo to that communion, which we have one with another, as mutual Members; and with Chriſt our Head, as his Body. So the Apoſtle teaches us when he ſaith, <hi>The Cup of Bleſſing, which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt? The Bread which we break, it is not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Body of Chriſt? For we being many are one Bread, and one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: for we are all partakers of that one Bread.</hi> 1 Cor. x. 16, 17. And therefore ſince we are not Members of the ſame Body, unleſs we be knit together in one; and we are not knit together in one, but by the Communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt; and we cannot have that communion but by Aſſembling together, to eat of one Bread, and drink of one Cup: it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to all that there is the greateſt neceſſity of Publick Aſſemblies, where this is the chief buſineſs, for which Chriſtians ſhould meet together in one Body as oft as is poſſible; and at all other times, beſeech God to accept
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:179513:106"/>their Sacrifices for the ſake of that perfect Sacrifice, Oblation, and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which Chriſt hath made, and which we commemorate.</p>
               <p>Here alſo, in the Publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, cenſures were inflicted upon publick Offenders, as we learn from the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> v. 4. as well as from <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apology:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>cap.</hi> xxxix.</note> and many ſuch like things I might add to the ſame purpoſe, if I had room for them; and had not other material conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to preſs, which ought not to be omitted.</p>

Among which, this is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, that the Publick Service of the Church, by them miniſtred, is ſo acceptable unto God; that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, God's Heavenly Miniſters, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in ſuch Holy Aſſemblies, and make a part of them. For this is the Reaſon St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> xi. 10. why a Woman ſhould cover her Head in time of Prayer, that is, be in a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and reverend poſture: <hi>becauſe of the Angels.</hi> Whoſe preſence in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Chriſtians, is a Token of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:179513:106"/>Chriſt's Bleſſed Preſence, in the midſt of them: according to his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe before-mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> xviii. 20. <hi>For where the Angels are ſaid to be, there God is preſent;</hi> as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> obſerve: and not without good ground for what they ſay. For when <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw Angels in a viſion, aſcending and deſcending upon a Ladder, which ſtood on the Earth, and reached unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he ſaid, as ſoon as he was awake; <hi>how dreadful is this place?</hi> (that is, with what reverence ſhould I behave my ſelf here?) <hi>this is no other but the Houſe of God, and this is the Gate of Heaven.</hi> He concludes God to be preſent, becauſe the Angels were; who are his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Attendants. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are to underſtand theſe words of the Apoſtle, as intended to ſignifie a Divine preſence among us; when we are reverently aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Worſhip God, in his Holy places.</p>
               <p>Which the Ancient Chriſtians lookt upon, as a ſingular incouragement to attend upon the Publick Prayers: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then a Chriſtian prays with the Angels, <gap reason="foreign">

Which if any Man forſake, he is no longer Holy, but Prophane; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing ſo far, the Chriſtian Faith: which teaches him to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints; by having Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them in Prayer, eſpecially in the Euchariſt, which is the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Chriſt's Body and Blood. By partaking of which, we have the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Communion alſo one with another: being made one Body, as I have ſaid already, by partaking all of that one Bread, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Communion</hi> indeed, or <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> is in one place, made a thing diſtinct, from <hi>breaking of Bread,</hi> and <hi>Prayers, Act.</hi> ii. 42. and ſignifies, ſome think, communicating to each others neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Which Notion of Communion,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:179513:108"/>if we underſtand to be meant in the Creed; it makes no leſs to my purpoſe than the other. For we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this was done in their Publick Aſſemblies: whereby their communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating to the needs of their Brethren, became an acceptable Offering unto God, together with their Prayers. This we learn from the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xvi. 1, 2. Where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Saints, as a part of the buſineſs of the firſt day of the Week; both there and in the Churches of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia.</hi> When they did not forget this well-pleaſing Sacrifice (as it is called <hi>Heb.</hi> xiii. 16.) but acknowledged God's bounty to themſelves, by the relief they ſent to others: and by ſuch a publick contribution, maintained alſo a ſenſe and fellow-feeling of one anothers condition; and made a profeſſion that they all belonged to one and the ſame Body, though never ſo far diſtant one from another. The Senſe of which we are apt to loſe; when we joyn not together in ſuch actions of piety. Whereby Brotherly Love and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe is likewiſe nouriſhed, and we are knit together in the tendereſt Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:179513:108"/>while we look upon one another, not only as Children of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father; but as Limbs of the ſame Body. Who naturally <hi>have the ſame care one for another: and whether one Member ſuffer, all the Members ſuffer with it: or one Member be honoured, all the Members rejoyce with it.</hi> 1 Corinth. xii. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>In this Brotherly Love, and in the ſame Faith, ſome think the Unity of the Body of Chriſt intirely conſiſts. But they ſhould conſider that this Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Love and Care flows from the Unity of Chriſt's Body: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts therefore, in the conjunction of every Member with the reſt, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing communion one with another, in all the common Offices of Religion, in Chriſtian Aſſemblies. From which whoſoever departs, or refuſes to joyn therein, he breaks the Unity of the Body of Chriſt, which is his Church. And though he do the ſame thing alone, which is done in thoſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, yet it is not the ſame thing in the account of Chriſt: who looks upon ſuch a Man as gone from him, by going from his Body, the Church.</p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:179513:109"/>
               <p n="10">X. I will add one thing more; which is, that the Service of God, in the Church triumphant in Heaven, is a Publick Service: and they do not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God ſeparately, there, but joyn together in his Praiſes. This we are taught by St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> vii. 11. where after a great multitude had been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, which no Man could number, of all Nations and Kindreds and Tongues; who ſtood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, crying with a loud voice, and ſaying, <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our God which ſitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb</hi> (whereby, no doubt, is ſignified the Service of the Chriſtian Church) then it follows, that <hi>All the Angels alſo ſtood round about the Throne, and about the Elders, and the four Beaſts, and fell before the Throne on their Faces, and Worſhipped God, ſaying,</hi> Amen. <hi>Bleſſing, and Glory, and Wiſdom, and Thanksgiving, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Power, and Might, be unto our God, for ever and ever.</hi> They ſaid, that is, <hi>Amen</hi> to the Chriſtian Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and alſo added their own: gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Glory to God in one Body (for it is the voice of <hi>all Angels</hi>) as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church did.</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:179513:109"/>
               <p>Let this be ſeriouſly pondered, and we ſhall indeavour to approach as near unto them as we can; by joyning, as they do, in one Society of the Church, to Worſhip God. For ſo doing, we joyn our ſelves to the Society alſo of the Holy Angels: as the Angels, St. <hi>John</hi> here informs us, do to the Society of Chriſtian Worſhippers. They and we make but one Body in Chriſt; in whom God <hi>hath gathered together in one all things; both which are in Heaven, and which are on Earth;</hi> And this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſts, it is manifeſt by this Viſion of St. <hi>John,</hi> in their communion one with another, in Holy Offices: which the Church in Heaven (where it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moſt perfectly one) doth moſt ſacredly keep and preſerve.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:179513:110"/>value; where God hath appointed his Miniſters to attend, and there offer up the Prayers of his people, and bleſs them in his Name; where the Angels alſo are preſent, and delight to ſee us aſſembled; that we may maintain the Communion of Saints here on Earth, and be fitted for the company of the Bleſſed in Heaven: who all joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in giving Bleſſing, and Praiſe, and Honour unto him, whom we Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; who is far Exalted above all Bleſſing, and Praiſe, either of ours on Earth, or of theirs in Heaven: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I ſay all this, and then think what an errour they live in, who make lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no account of the Publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; but imagine they can pray and ſerve God, as well by themſelves alone. This is a moſt unchriſtian thought, directly contrary to the very frame of our Holy Religion: which therefore ought, with all diligence, to be explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of every one of our minds.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe who do not barely neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Publick Service, but refuſe to joyn in it, they are ſtill in a far worſe condition: having broken themſelves off from the Body of Chriſt; which the

Among whom he can never hope to find any entertainment, nor to be received into the Coeleſtial Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: having ſhut himſelf here out of the Society of Saints, and the place where God's Honour dwelleth.</p>
               <p>Would to God ſuch things as theſe were ſeriouſly and deeply conſidered by us all, that our minds might be awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to a diligent and conſtant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Publick Aſſemblies. Which our Lord hath taken the greateſt care to eſtabliſh; and unto which he hath alſo granted very high Priviledges: leſt they ſhould fall into contempt or neglect, through Mens
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:179513:112"/>Idleneſs, or Covetouſneſs, or Concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs, or by any other means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Certain it is, if we had an hearty Love to our Religion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it, we could not but be ſo in Love with the Publick Exerciſes of it; as every day, if it lay in our power, to go into God's houſe, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend our ſelves, and his whole Church to his Grace and Mercy. For there is no way, it is evident from what hath been ſaid, to uphold and ſupport the Church like to this: we being a Church, by meeting together, to have communion in the ſame Prayers. Which the oftner we have, the more we look like a Church, and act like Members of the Body of Chriſt: who are combined and knit together, for mutual preſervation. As on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the ſeldomer we meet, the leſs there is of the face of a Church among us: which cannot be preſerved from ruin, when the Publick Aſſemblies are generally neglected, becauſe the Church falls to decay, by that very neglect.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore ſet our ſelves to maintain the Church of which we are
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:179513:112"/>Members, by maintaining Publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies; and ſuffering no day to paſs without a ſolemn meeting in as full a Body as we can make, for the duties of our Religion. This would be both an Ornament, and a Strength and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment to our Religion. The Truth which we profeſs, would hereby be both honoured and confirmed: and appear with greater Authority, as well as Beauty in the Eyes of all its Adverſaries; when they beheld the Multitude, the Unanimity, and the Order and Conſtancy of thoſe that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it. The better and gentler ſort of them would be the more eaſily won to joyn with us; and they whoſe hearts are alienated from us, would be the leſs inclin'd to ſet themſelves againſt us.</p>
               <p>And, for the Grace and Favour of God, which is the chief thing of all, Chriſtians may promiſe it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their protection againſt all their Adverſaries, when they conſtantly and earneſtly ſeek it, with their joynt Prayers and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Which will be powerful alſo for the ſetling ſuch, as are wavering in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:179513:113"/>their Religion: whom the conſtant Authority likewiſe of a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of faithful people, cannot but be of much moment to contain in their Duty; for Men are aſhamed to forſake a multitude, when they eaſily deſert ſmall Numbers.</p>
               <p>The Ancient Chriſtians were ſo poſſeſſed with this ſenſe, that they lookt upon their Prayers, as <hi>the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable Bulwark of the Church, an unſhaken Garriſon; terrible to the Devils, and ſalutary to God's pious Worſhipp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi>

               <p>And thus our own Church, in the ſecond Collect for Morning Prayer, by teaching us to look upon our <hi>Eternal Life as ſtanding in the knowledge of God,</hi> and to eſteem his <hi>ſervice to be perfect freedom,</hi> inforces our reſort unto him continually for our defence in that Service and Knowledge, <hi>in all aſſaults of our Enemies:</hi> The Effect of which it inſtructs us to hope will be this, <hi>that we ſurely truſting in his defence, may not fear the power of any Adverſaries, through the might of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> This St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> admirably repreſents,

               <p>For which reaſon it was, that the Enemies of our Religion, bent their Forces not ſo much againſt particular perſons, as againſt their Aſſemblies: which they indeavoured with all their might to deſtroy, as the Nurſeries of the Chriſtian Faith. Which being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, they doubted not but the Faith it ſelf would be loſt, in that diſorder. They no longer lookt upon Chriſtians as a Church, when they did not meet together: but as ſo many ſcattered Limbs of a Body, which no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſubſiſts, when the Members are diſtracted, and torn aſunder. Againſt theſe ſtrong holds therefore they laid their Batteries; hoping when they were beaten down, they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently triumph over their Religion. Which they knew it was hard to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; whilſt a great Body of Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, knit together continually for its ſupport, by many Bonds, and Holy Myſteries, and the ſtricteſt Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:179513:115"/>
               <p>For which cauſe likewiſe it was, that Chriſtian people could not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to omit their Aſſemblies; no not in time of Perſecution, when there was the greateſt danger, if they held them. We learn ſo much from their very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors; particularly from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Letter which <hi>Pliny</hi> wrote to the Emperour <hi>Trajan</hi> about this matter: wherein we are informed, that, when it was not ſafe in the day time, they met before the Morning Light to ſing Hymns to Chriſt, as their God. To what ſhall we impute this Zeal? Might they not have ſerved God as well alone? No, they underſtood their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion better, than to be of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and knew it could not ſtand, if they did not thus joyn together to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it. Their Enemies, they knew, wiſht for nothing more, than that theſe Aſſemblies might be broken: which, whilſt they continued, were <hi>the Pillar and Stay</hi> of the Chriſtian Truth.</p>
               <p>And do we pretend to be Chriſtians, and to love our Religion, and to deſire, nay hope for its ſafety and proſperity, and make ſo little Account of theſe Holy Aſſemblies, that the ſmalleſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:179513:115"/>will hinder our attendance on them? Let us not, againſt the cleareſt demonſtrations, perſiſt in ſuch a ſtupid error. But awaken, or rather inflame our ſelves unto ſuch a degree of Zeal, as to meet together dayly, where we have opportunity for it; to give Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God in his Church by Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; and to commend his Church, as well as our ſelves and Families, to the protection of his good Providence, ſaying, <hi>O Lord, ſave thy People, and bleſs thine Inheritance.</hi> It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined what ſatisfaction we ſhould find herein; did we make this our moſt ſerious buſineſs: and, inſtead of the excuſes we now make for our negligence, give all diligence thus to adorn, confirm, and ſecure our moſt Holy Religion.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied indeed, that this hath been an Error of long ſtanding: For when the Church had reſt from Perſecution, her Children began, by degrees, to grow remiſs and wanton. Proſperity and eaſe corrupted them; and they cooled ſo much in their firſt love, that many of them came but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to do their Duty unto God their
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:179513:116"/>Saviour. But this was an extream great grief to their Paſtors: and brought the heavieſt calamities upon Chriſtian people. Hear how the often na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Father bewails this, <q>That the Church having brought forth many Children, ſhe could not enjoy their Company,

               <p>IT may be thought, perhaps, by ſome, that I go too far, in preſſing a day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attendance upon the Publick Prayers; which they imagine is but a ſuperfluous piece of Devotion, a great deal more than needs: But if they would lay a very few things together, and conſider them ſeriouſly they would alter their Opinion.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let it be conſidered that there was Anciently, a Morning and an Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sacrifice, every day publickly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God at the Temple: which was called the <hi>Continual Burnt-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ordained by him on Mount <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:179513:118"/>the re-iterated Precepts of the Goſpel, which require us to <hi>pray alway,</hi> and to <hi>pray without ceaſing,</hi> were never thought by any Chriſtian to ſignifie leſs, than praying as oft as, the <hi>Jews</hi> offered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; that is Morning, and Evening, which may, with propriety enough, be called, <hi>praying continually,</hi> or, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing;</hi> as thoſe Morning and Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sacrifices at the Temple, were called the <hi>Continual Burnt-Offering:</hi> And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That no reaſon can be given, why thoſe Sacrifices were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly offered, which will not make it as neceſſary that we ſhould have Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers: which are moſt for the Honour of God, I have proved before, and every way moſt advantagious to us: And then we can make no other concluſion but this, that Morning and Evening Prayer ought every day to be offered to God in our Publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; and that we ought to be glad of the opportunity to joyn therein, as the People did with the Prieſt, who mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the Temple. For when he was in the Sanctuary at the Altar of Incenſe, praying, <hi>The whole multitude of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were praying without, at the time of Incenſe,</hi> Luk. i. 10, 11, 13.</p>

               <p>All the people of the Land indeed could not poſſibly come thither every day to Worſhip: But they had their <hi>Synagogues</hi> in the Country, where at the time of Morning and Evening Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, they met together to pray, and hear the Law of God read to them. And a certain number of Men were likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed from among them,

Which things conſidered, we cannot think it fit to have no Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, but only on the Lord's Day: eſpecially when we obſerve that the Ancient Prophets expreſly ſay, there ſhould be as frequent Devotion in the Dayes of Chriſt, as there had been in former times.

                  </gap>ident, from the <hi>Offerings</hi> which it is there ſaid
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:179513:119"/>ſhall be brought to him; and from the effect hereof in the 17 ver. <hi>His Name ſhall be continued for ever: and Men ſhall be bleſſed in him; all Nations ſhall call him bleſſed.</hi> Thus the <hi>Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt</hi> underſtood thoſe words, ver. 5. <hi>They ſhall fear thee, as long as the Sun and Moon endure throughout all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> that is, ſaith he, they ſhall in all ages, <hi>pray before thee</hi> (which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the <hi>fear of God,</hi> whereby is often meant his Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) <hi>with the Sun, and before, or in the preſence of the Moon.</hi> As much as to ſay, in the Morning when the Sun ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and again at Night, when the Moon ſhines, they ſhall by Devout Prayers expreſs their Reverence to him, the King of the World.</p>
               <p>Where people, indeed, in Country Villages lye ſcattered one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and have abundance of buſineſs which call them ſeveral wayes, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected that there ſhould be every day ſuch Aſſemblies. But in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and in Market Towns, where they live nearer together, and have, on moſt dayes, a great deal of leiſure (which to my knowledge is ſpent by
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:179513:120"/>many people there, in mere idleneſs or pleaſure) it is of abſolute neceſſity, if we will do our Duty compleatly to God our Saviour, that Aſſemblies ſhould be maintained and frequented, as they Anciently were, and ſtill are in moſt parts of the Chriſtian World. For the Apoſtles of Chriſt immediately upon his Aſcenſion unto Heaven, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the Ancient Practice of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Devotion, being <hi>continually (i. e.</hi> at Morning and Evening Prayer) <hi>in the Temple, Praiſing, and Bleſſing God,</hi> Luk. xxiv. 53. And after, by the power of the Holy Ghoſt coming on them, they had ſetled Churches, we read the <hi>four living Creatures,</hi> and <hi>the twenty four Elders</hi> (by which are certainly meant the Governours of the Chriſtian Church) <hi>reſted not Day and Night, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> &amp;c. that is, Morning and Evening they fell down before God, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him that liveth for ever and ever. Which Practice hath ever ſince continued in the Church; which, in that Heavenly Hymn, commonly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> hath conſtantly ſaid, <hi>Day by day we magnifie thy Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:179513:120"/>
               <p>For which end certain hours, as well as a certain place, have been alwayes appointed, that Men might ſo order their other Affairs, as to be able to mind this great buſineſs; of giving Thanks and Praiſe to God, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all, and imploring his Bleſſing on them in their ſeveral Callings and Conditions, and on their Church and Country, and finally on the whole World. It is ſo ſure that the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſuch ſet hours of Prayer, that I do not think fit to ſay much of a matter ſo well known. I will only note that they were the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> hour, the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Which the Chriſtian Church afterward obſerved, and that from the Example of the Apoſtles themſelves. For St. <hi>Peter</hi> even when he was not at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> went <hi>up to the houſe-top to pray, about the ſixth hour, i. e.</hi> Twelve a Clock. Which we cannot doubt was his uſual cuſtome: and as little doubt that it was the cuſtom of the other Apoſtles; and by them every where propagated, throughout all the Churches. Which, the Ancient Writers of Chriſtianity tell us obſerved thoſe very ſet hours of Prayer: So <hi>Clemens</hi> in his <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:179513:121"/>vii. 24. and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> in L. vii. of his <hi>Stromata,</hi> where he calls them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the ſet, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hours. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book of <hi>Faſting,</hi> chap. 10. <hi>Origen</hi> alſo in his Book of Prayer, proves from ſeveral Scripture Examples, that it ought not to be made leſs than <hi>three</hi> times every day. N. 38. And ſuch was the Practice in St. <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> dayes, I ſhall have occaſion to ſhow, in the end of this Chapter: which is ſtill continued in our great Churches every where. I will here only tranſcribe the Words of St. <hi>Hierom</hi> upon the vi. Dan. 10. <hi>There are three times, in which our knees ought to be bowed to God, at the third hour, the ſixth, and the ninth, as the Eccleſiaſtical Tradition inſtructs us. At the third hour the Holy Ghoſt deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Apoſtles: At the ſixth</hi> Peter <hi>went up to pray in the upper Chamber: And at the ninth,</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John <hi>went up together into the Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether the Publick Service of God was every where celebrated <hi>three times</hi> a day; or only upon the Lord's Day, and in great Cities every Day, may juſtly be queſtioned. And I incline to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:179513:121"/>think it was not every day, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, celebrated more than twice: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> aſcribed to the Apoſtles (which are undoubtedly very Ancient) injoyn no more, but Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening Prayer. The words are very remarkable, directed to the Biſhop; to whom they ſay,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>Conſtit.</hi> 58.</note> 
                  <hi>Command and Exhort the people, to come continually to Church, Morning and Evening every day; and not to fail at all:</hi> and then, they mention in the ſame place, three Services upon the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> as more ſolemn than all the reſt. Which is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſutable to God's appointment among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had daily the Morning and Evening Offering: And on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, another Offering, <hi>beſide the Continual Burnt-Offering,</hi> as we read ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>Numb.</hi> xxviii. 9, 10. They had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed at the Temple, other Offerings eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, about 12 a Clock: but they were not the Sacrifices of the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the Morning and Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sacrifices were, but the Sacrifices of particular Perſons, on particular Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. And accordingly all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans prayed publickly twice every day,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:179513:122"/>Morning and Evening: and had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hour alſo for Private Prayers, which was about Noon: conformable to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Evening and Morning, and at Noon will I pray, and cry aloud: and he ſhall hear my voice,</hi> Pſal. lv. 17.</p>
               <p>It muſt not here be forgotten, there were likewiſe two of the Week dayes more ſolemnly obſerved than the reſt for Publick Prayers, <hi>viz. Wedneſdayes,</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> as hath been elſewhere proved
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Treatiſe of Repentance pag.</hi> 112.</note>. On which dayes there were three Services, in ſome places, as on the Lord's Day: And in all places, they took ſpecial care that nothing ſhould keep them then from the Publick Aſſemblies, how negligent ſoever they were at other times. And the devouter ſort alſo faſted, on thoſe two dayes; that they might have more time for Prayer, and be excited to greater fervour in it, by a deep ſenſe of their own unworthineſs, of the leaſt of God's Bleſſings.</p>
               <p>And do we now think to pleaſe God, and to preſerve our Religion, without any of this care, either on thoſe dayes,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:179513:122"/>or on others, but only the Lord's Day? Then the Chriſtian Church in all ages, till theſe later times, hath been too officious, though it followed the plain Inſtructions, and the beſt patterns of the Holy Scriptures. Which have been ſo univerſally underſtood to enjoyn a daily publick Service of God, that there is no Chriſtian Country, that I can find at this day, by whom this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute is not pay'd unto him. All the Eaſtern Chriſtians (as a Learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and great Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler hath informed us

So we have in theſe Iſlands, and in many places, <hi>full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations alſo:</hi> though in others alas! either no publick Aſſemblies, or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly empty. Which is a very great ſhame, as the forementioned Dr. ſpeaks, that when now under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:179513:123"/>God doth not require our Lambs (which were offered publickly twice every day by the <hi>Jews</hi>) we ſhould not dayly give him the <hi>Calves of our Lips,</hi> as the Prophets phraſe is: that is, Pray to him, and Praiſe him, and give him Thanks in the publick Congregation.</p>
               <p>Why the Reformed Churches in <hi>France</hi> did not thus conſtantly Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as they do in <hi>Germany,</hi> it is not my buſineſs to enquire. Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> I am ſure both approved of this Practice, and wiſht it were reſtored, in more pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Works than one: by note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, what I have ſaid will be confirmed, and ſome reaſon alſo given of this Omiſſion. For having obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that God appointed a

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:179513:123"/>haberi tales conventus,</hi> and at this day, if too much <hi>ſluggiſhneſs</hi> did not hinder, it would be uſeful every day to hold ſuch Aſſemblies. And in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon the fourth Commandment,
<note place="margin">

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tinam illud quidem daretur,</hi> &amp;c. Would to God we were able ſo to do: For certainly it was a worthy Spiritual Wiſdom, which ſpared a little porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time every day from other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for God's Service. But if we cannot obtain from the infirmity of many, that dayly Aſſemblies may be held, and reſpect to Charity doth not permit us to exact more of them; Why do we not yield Obedience to that which we ſee by the Will of God is impoſed upon us? And he thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:179513:124"/>his Explication of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. <hi>This general Doctrine is eſpecially to be held: That Holy Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be diligently and Religiouſly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſuch external helps conſtantly uſed, as may ſerve to ſupport and cheriſh the Worſhip of God; leſt Religion either fall to the Ground, or languiſh among us.</hi>

               <p>To which I think fit to add, what his opinion was concerning ſet times of Prayer; for his Words are very inſtructive.

For the daily Sacrifice was offered every <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening:</hi> And the <hi>mid-Day,</hi> ſaith he, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for other Sacrifices.

               <p>The benefit of which is this among others; that where there are no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies, or Men cannot, by reaſon of ſickneſs, or other urgent cauſe, attend them, they may at thoſe ſet times offer ſome ſhort Prayer to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:179513:125"/>God in private, and deſire the publick Prayers of the Church, where they are continually made, may be accepted with him. By which means they are in ſome ſort preſent there, and the Prayers they make in private become a part of the publick: they praying as Members of that Body, which is then met together in the Houſe of God. Thus St. <hi>Peter</hi> prayed privately, as I obſerved above, at the ſixth hour, when they were praying at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in Chriſtian Aſſemblies: and though alone at that time, yet he choſe the ſame hours with theirs; that his Prayers might be joyned with the reſt, and not be ſingle, but united de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
               <p>Thus St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> directs his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in anſwer to thoſe who objected unto his preſſing Arguments for atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the publick Prayers, how is it poſſible for a Secular Man ingaged in buſineſs, <q>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:179513:125"/>to run to the Church ſo oft, yet it is eaſie for him, even when he is in publick buſineſs to pray to God: unto which not ſo much the voice is requiſite, as the mind. And therefore let no Man excuſe himſelf by ſaying, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the Houſe of Prayer is not near to mine: for if we be watchful, the Grace of the Holy Spirit, will make every one of us a Temple of God. She that ſits at the Spindle, may look up to Heaven in her thoughts, and call upon God with fervent deſires; and ſo may he that is in the Market, or in a Journey, or in his Shop, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Shoes; in like manner a Servant, he that buyes Meat, he that dreſſes it, and all the reſt: when it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to come to Church, they may notwithſtanding make fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and lively Prayers to God; who doth not deſpiſe the place where they are made, but deſires alone warm Affections, and a ſerious, compoſed Mind. And he concludes thus: My meaning in all that I have ſaid is this; That we ſhould go to Church as oft as is poſſible; and when we cannot,

               <p>And all this it becomes us to do in the humbleſt manner; according to the invitation and direction of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> which is recited every day at Morning Prayer, <hi>O come, let us Worſhip, and fall down: and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Church hath never been acquainted with any other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture but this of <hi>kneeling,</hi> in their Prayers to God: ſaving only between <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> when in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Chriſt's Reſurrection they were wont to <hi>ſtand.</hi> Which was the common poſture of Prayer among the <hi>Jews,</hi> except in time of trouble and diſtreſs; when they alſo fell upon their knees, <hi>Dan.</hi> ix. 20. Nay, when they would expreſs the greateſt Submiſſion, Lowlineſs, Reverence, and Fear, they fell upon their Faces, as our Saviour
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:179513:127"/>did, juſt before his Agony, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxvi. 39. A poſture far more remote from theirs, who ſit at their Prayers: which no man dare do, who is poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with an awful ſenſe of his diſtance from God, and conſiders how mean a Creature he is, and how unworthy to receive the ſmalleſt favour from his hands. In ſhort, we may ſay to ſuch Men as <hi>Malachi</hi> doth to thoſe, who brought vile Offerings unto the Altar, with a little alteration, <hi>Go now to thy Governour</hi> and petition him in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, <hi>Will he be pleaſed with thee, or accept of thy perſon?</hi> No Man hath the face to preſent himſelf unto his Prince in this ſaucy manner; eſpecially when he comes to beg Mercy of him, and pray him to ſpare his Life, which he hath forfeited to him. And therefore let none of us venture to approach thus, into the preſence of the Great King over all the Earth, the Soveraign of the World: But caſt down our ſelves with ſuch lowly Reverence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, as may teſtifie that we Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Moſt High.

Nature inclines us to it, if we have any ſenſe of our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though we had no inſtructions about it, no Examples to move us to it. And therefore I may truly ſay, that we diveſt our ſelves even of Humanity; when we are ſo rude, as to ſit at Prayer: unleſs we be in ſuch a condition, as not to be able either to fall on our knees, or ſtand before the Divine Majeſty. Then indeed we may be confident he will not reject our Prayers, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the poſture of our Body be: but hear them as he did St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <q>when he prayed and praiſed God in Priſon, with his feet in the ſtocks; and <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> who lay on his Bed by reaſon of his infirmity, and cryed to him; and the Thief, who prayed as he hung on the Croſs, and found favour with

With which he that refuſeth to joyn, we may conclude him, not to know what it is to pray alone, either ſecretly or at home. As on the other ſide, he that neglects to pray alone and privately, may be thought to put up vain Prayers, though he frequent the publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies: becauſe he reſpects more the Opinion of Men, than the ſecret Judgment of God. In the mean time, leſt the <hi>Common Prayers of the Church</hi> ſhould fall into contempt, God hath adorned them with ſplendid Elogies: eſpecially when he calls the Temple, <hi>an houſe of Prayer,</hi> Iſa. lvi. 7. For by this Speech he inſtructs us that the principal part of his Worſhip, is the Office of Prayer: in which that the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:179513:128"/>faithful might exerciſe themſelves with one conſent, the Temple was erected and lifted up to them like a Banner, that they might all reſort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxv. 2. Where there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a famous promiſe added, ver. 1. <hi>Praiſe expecteth thee, O God in Sion: and unto thee ſhall the Vow be performed in Jeruſalem.</hi> In which words the Prophet admoniſhes, That <hi>the Prayers of the Church are never in vain:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God perpetually adminiſters to his people matter of ſinging his Praiſe with joy.</q>

               <p>WHen I reflect upon the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I cannot but fear that they are void of the love of God, or very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in it; who have ſo little regard to his Honour, as not to love the place where his <hi>Honour dwelleth,</hi> and where <hi>Praiſe waiteth for him;</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, in the place now named: that is, where his Glorious Majeſty is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled, his wonderful Works are mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; his Benefits acknowledged; and Pſalms ſung in Honour of him; which is the greateſt buſineſs of our ſolemn Aſſemblies. For Men hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more willingly than the Praiſes of their Parents: There they delight to be, and are never weary of their
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:179513:129"/>attendance there; where the noble acts of their Anceſtors are recited, with Songs or Speeches in their Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. And therefore with much more diligence ſhould we run thither, without ceaſing; <hi>where Men ſpeak of the glorious Honour of his Majeſty, and of the wondrous Works of our Heavenly Father:</hi> and declare the love of our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>making known his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Acts, and the Glorious Majeſty of his Kingdom; uttering abundantly the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his great Goodneſs, and ſinging of his Righteouſneſs.</hi> Though alas! <hi>Who can utter the mighty Acts of the Lord? Who can ſhew forth all his Praiſe?</hi> As the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks elſewhere. His benefits towards us are immenſely great, and cannot worthily be praiſed by us: But it is our Duty to do what we can; that we may purſue what we ought.

               <p>Which is a new conſideration to quicken us to this Duty, and to ſilence all thoſe Objections which are apt to riſe in our hearts againſt it.</p>
               <p>Yes, may ſome ſay, We like the thing you preſs: but are againſt the way of doing it, in this Church. In which ſome are diſtaſted at all Forms of Prayer: and others at that Form, wherein we Worſhip God, and him alone.</p>
               <p>Unto the firſt of theſe, I have this to ſay; That when there were no Forms of Prayer left in this Church, they that deſtroyed them did not dayly hold publick Aſſemblies: Nor do they now make it their conſtant practice. Which gives us too much cauſe to think, they have not ſuch a ſenſe, as is to be wiſhed, of their neceſſity. But, to let that paſs, ſuppoſing ſome have, and that they only diſlike a Form of Prayer; it is ſomething ſtrange, that the ſame Arguments which make them think dayly publick Aſſemblies to be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſhould not alſo reconcile them to a Form of Prayer. Which was conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed by the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> in their Aſſemblies, as hath been undeniably
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:179513:131"/>proved by many of our Writers; and was preſcribed by our Bleſſed Lord and Maſter, who made his Prayer, I have ſhown, for the publick Service: in which he joyned with the <hi>Jews</hi> when he was at the Temple in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and when he was in the Country, went to the <hi>Synagogues;</hi> which the Chaldee Paraphraſt calls <hi>Houſes of Praiſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>in Iſa.</hi> vii. 19.</note> And ſo did his Apoſtles; who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves uſed a conſtant Form of Praiſe: For they reſted not Day and Night ſaying, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come,</hi> Rev. iv. 8. This, as I ſhowed before, was their <hi>continual Hymn,</hi> which they offered to God: and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s uſual way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending the Churches to whom he wrote, unto the Grace of God, that they had their Forms of Prayer alſo. For he himſelf conſtantly uſed theſe words, <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, be with you all.</hi> 2 Theſſ. iii. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>The ſame Power every Biſhop had in his Church, to compoſe Prayers for the neceſſities of it: as we may gather
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:179513:131"/>from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 1, 2. Which Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is directed not to the people, but to <hi>Timothy:</hi> who was to take care to have all Men recommended unto God in the publick Offices, by <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Supplications,</hi> with <hi>Interceſſions</hi> and <hi>Thankſgivings:</hi> for Kings eſpecially, and for all in Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This could not be done <hi>orderly</hi> (as all things were to be in the Chriſtian Church) without a ſet Form of Words; which <hi>Timothy,</hi> we may well think, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For thoſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that Prayers be made,</hi> ſignifie as literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Apoſtle would have <hi>Prayers and Supplications compoſed,</hi> as that he would have them <hi>put up to God.</hi> And I doubt not they ſignifie both; Firſt That they ſhould be compoſed; and then put up to God by the Church.</p>
               <p>For you may obſerve further that the Apoſtles ſpeak of this as their work, <hi>Act.</hi> vi. 4. where having bidden the Church look out ſome Men to be appointed to attend the buſineſs, of providing for the poor, they add; <hi>but we will give our ſelves continually to Prayer, and to the Miniſtry of the Word.</hi> They made the Prayers where they
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:179513:132"/>were preſent, as much as they miniſtred the Word. Which is further manifeſt from hence, that the Prayers of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> are called the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Prayers:</hi> Act. ii. 42. <hi>And they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers.</hi> Obſerve here how all the faithful ſtedfaſtly continued in Prayers, as well as hearing the Word: And that they are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> called <hi>Prayers,</hi> in the Plural number; not one but many Prayers: and then, that they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Apoſtles Prayers;</hi> Prayers made by them. For the word <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the beginning belongs to all the <hi>three</hi> things that follow, as well as to the <hi>firſt:</hi> To the Apoſtles <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> and their breaking of Bread, and their <hi>Prayers,</hi> as well as to their <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be brief, as <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> being a publick Miniſter ſent of God, taught his Diſciples how to pray; and our Bleſſed Lord, taught his Apoſtles: So his Apoſtles in like manner taught thoſe whom they Converted, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the pattern Chriſt had left them; and, no queſtion, delivered the ſame power to thoſe that ſhould have the

               <p>It may be thought indeed that the <hi>Extraordinary Gift</hi> they had in thoſe dayes ſupplyed all.

And nothing tended more to the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Church, than that it ſhould have a ſtanding known Form of Prayers and Praiſes (without which it could not be known how they Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped God) and not depend merely upon that extraordinary Gift: which was not conſtant, but vouchſafed only on ſome ſpecial occaſion, according as God pleaſed to impart it. Which is not ſaid arbitrarily by me, but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by a convincing Argument, that this extraordinary Gift was not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſerve the conſtant neceſſities of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:179513:133"/>the Church, but only ſome particular purpoſes: for they who had it could not make others underſtand it; and are therefore directed by the Apoſtle to pray they might be able to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret; that others might reap ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereby, and be able to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> thereunto. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> xiv. 13, 14, 15, 16.

               </p>
               <p>And this place of the Apoſtle puts me in mind of another undeniable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for preſcribed Forms of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Chriſtian Church: which
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:179513:133"/>is, that ſinging Pſalms and Hymns made up a great part of that Worſhip, and could not poſſibly be performed by the whole Congregation, unleſs they had before them that which was to be ſung. Therefore <hi>ſinging by the Spirit,</hi> that is, by a Spiritual Gift, the Apoſtle makes ſmall account of, unleſs what was ſung were put into ſuch words, that all the people might underſtand it, and ſing God's Praiſes together with him that was inſpired. This is the Apoſtles meaning, when he bids them <hi>ſpeak among themſelves in Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs,</hi> ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>and making melody in their heart to the Lord.</hi> Epheſ. v. 19. Where by <hi>Pſalms</hi> I think all agree are meant the Pſalms of <hi>David;</hi> which were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſet Form of Praiſe: <hi>Hymns and Spiritual Songs</hi> were the compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, its like, of inſpired perſons then in the Church; which could not be ſung by all, unleſs they were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the whole Company: And then they were a Form alſo; and we may well think were ſung more than once; it being very reaſonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that they had not, every time
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:179513:134"/>they met, a new Hymn, no more than a new Pſalm. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> blames it as a confuſed, unedifying thing, that when they came together (met, that is, in the publick Aſſemblies) every one had his particular Pſalm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv. 26. and commands all <hi>things ſhould be done to edifying:</hi> by making the Pſalm common, that is; ſo that all might be the better for it. Such, I perſwade my ſelf, were the Prayers and Hymns which St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſung in Priſon: not each of them their own Private Prayer, and Hymn, but ſome Common Prayer, and Form of Praiſe, which they were wont to uſe. <hi>Act.</hi> xvi. 25.</p>
               <p>Such Hymns it is certain there were in the Church, which were ſung every Morning in praiſe of our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; as <hi>Pliny</hi> himſelf teſtifies: And <hi>Euſebius</hi> produces an Ancient Writer aſſerting the Divinity of our Saviour, out of the Hymns that had been of old uſed in the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

               <p>As for following Ages, we find fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent mention of Liturgies formed by the Apoſtles themſelves; particularly by St. <hi>James:</hi> Unto which though ſome Additions perhaps had been then made, as there have been more ſince, yet it is hard to think that a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Biſhops would have owned a Liturgy, as compoſed by St. <hi>James,</hi> if there had not been a conſtant tradition among them, that the Apoſtles left ſome ſtated Form of Prayer and Praiſe,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:179513:136"/>in the Churches which they gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>But what need I trouble my ſelf with a long proof of this matter, when we have the Confeſſion of the moſt Learned and Beſt Men among thoſe, whom they that diſſent from us have been wont to reverence, that there hath been no time wherein there was not a preſcribed Form of Divine Service?

               <p>Would to God they that ſcruple it would weigh ſuch things as theſe: it would not be long then, before they liked, nay loved that Form of Prayer which is uſed in this Church. For it is ſo exactly conformable to the Rule of the Holy Apoſtle, which I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mentioned 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 1. conſiſting of unexceptionable <hi>Prayers, Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Interceſſions,</hi> and <hi>Thankſgivings,</hi> that one cannot but think the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of it laid that Rule before them, when they framed it.

               <p>It directs our Prayers to the ever Bleſſed Trinity, Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt: the only Object of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and Fountain of Mercy. Of whom we firſt deprecate evil things: and that in the right order; firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to be delivered from the evil of Sin, both of the Spirit and of the fleſh; and then from the evil of puniſhment, whether in outward, or in inward judgments. All this we pray to be delivered from, by what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered for us; and by that alone: which is the moſt prevalent way of ſuing for Mercy. And by the way obſerve, that what ſome, through miſunderſtanding I hope, have been pleaſed to make the Subject of their
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:179513:138"/>Mirth and Sport, is really, and ought to be eſteemed, the moſt ſerious and effectual Supplication that can be made to our Lord. <hi>By whoſe Holy Nativity and Circumciſion, by his Baptiſm, Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Temptation: by his Agony and bloody Sweat, by his Croſs and Paſſion, by his Pretious Death and Burial, by his Glorious Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and by the Coming of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> we pray to be delivered. For thus it is, Our Lord having humbled himſelf to be a Man for our ſakes, nay to take on him the form of a Servant, and, after all his other Sufferings, at laſt to dye the Death of the Croſs for us; is gone, with that Blood which was there ſhed, into the Heavens, and is exalted at God's Right Hand in the High and Holy Place: where he repreſents all that he did and ſuffered, from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the World till his going out of it, before God; and in the vertue of his bloody Sacrifice, which he made of himſelf, pleads to have every thing from God, which he hath promiſed, and cannot be denied. Now for us to beſeech him, that through the force of his Sufferings of all ſorts, eſpecially
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:179513:138"/>of his cruel Death, and the Glory that followed, we may be delivered and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from all evil, is the moſt patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, the moſt powerful way of intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the moſt prevailing importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that can be uſed. It is as if we ſhould ſay, Lord ſhow unto the Father what thou haſt indured for us: repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto him thy obedience unto Death; which he promiſed to reward with all power in Heaven and in Earth. Exerciſe thy Royal Power which thou haſt obtained, by that humble Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for our Deliverance and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As thou haſt received the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, and imparted it to thy Apoſtles, ſo pour it down more and more upon us alſo; who believe the Goſpel which they preached and teſtified to be the truth.</p>
               <p>Then follow Petitions for all good things: Firſt, For the Univerſal Church; then for our own in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.

But we
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:179513:140"/>ought to take care that out of eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to avoid that Extream, we do not fall into another; as they do who affirm that Spiritual Paſtors muſt only then be obeyed when they determine and give Direction out of the expreſs Laws of God. For as the former take away all Authority from God's Word: ſo this takes away all Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from God's Miniſters, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives them of that Obedience, which by God's Word is due unto them.</p>

For as the latter is the Mother of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry:</hi> ſo the former is the Mother of <hi>Schiſms, Preſumption, Carnal Security,</hi> and <hi>Infidelity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Rocks cannot be avoided, but by a due ſubmiſſion to the Guides of Souls, in things wherein God hath not plainly ordered the contrary. And therefore, if any have been ſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as by their Education, to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed a diſlike to ſuch a way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as they preſcribe, and to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with Fears, it may not be the right way, though they cannot ſay wherein it contradicts God's Holy Word: Theſe fears, and all ſuch like things, are to be overballanced and weighed down by the Authority of Spiritual Guides and Governours. Which is good for little if it cannot ſettle ſuch doubts and ſcruples; over which it will prevail, if Men conſider that God commands us to obey them: And therefore their Commandments are but particular Branches of God's General Commandment, to give Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:179513:141"/>to them. Inſomuch that they who diſobey them, diſobey God: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs their Commands be contrary to ſome other of the Divine Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as plain as that which ſayes, <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. xiii. 17.</p>
               <p>Which Truths, if they were root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our hearts, and Men had a juſt ſenſe of ſuch a thing, as Spiritual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Spiritual Governours: They would rather like well of the things preſcribed by them, for the ſake of their Authority, by whom they are preſcribed; than diſobey their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, upon the account of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate diſlike, which they have to ſuch preſcriptions.</p>
               <p>Make application of all this (which I have repreſented out of the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Author, in fewer words) to our own Church, and its Worſhip, and Governours: who have framed a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service for us exactly conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the moſt Ancient and Pure Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns; with ſuch care, with ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, and conſcientious regard to the Directions the Apoſtles have
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:179513:142"/>left us, that none of its Enemies can find any thing in it, as to the ſubſtance, which is not theirs. And therefore this may be juſtly called, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard as well as others, a truly Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical, Catholick Church. From which let no Man withdraw himſelf; but dread the guilt of ſuch a crime. That is, let him fear to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from its Publick Aſſemblies, from the Common Prayers, and from Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to its Governours. For if any Man be led from theſe, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of purer Worſhip, unto ſeparate Meetings, managed by thoſe who own not the Authority of this Churches Governours; it is moſt certain he is not guided by the Spirit of Chriſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but by the Spirit of Error and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion.</p>
               <p>Of which a very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Perſon
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Praeface to</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralipom. Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica.</note> hath lately given this plain demonſtration; that if Men had ſuch a meaſure of the Spirit as makes them living Members of the Body of Chriſt, they could not but feel, what ſenſibly hurts that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; what palpably hinders the growth
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:179513:142"/>of it; what diſgraces and reproaches it; what wounds it, nay hazzards the very Life and Being of it. They that want this neceſſary ſympathy, and ſenſe of the common good of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, and the intereſt of his Kingdom, cannot juſtly pretend to any competent portion of his Spirit. For what is more neceſſary for our preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, than that we keep together in one Body, under the ſame Guides and Governours; that we keep in the way, which the Church of Chriſt hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes trod, and be not hurried into Opinions and Practices ſo unlike the truly Ancient and Apoſtolical Church, that we bear no reſemblance to it? For that Church had Miniſters ſuperior to the reſt (as indeed the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church had) who governed, and ruled them, and the people; it had forms of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, ſuch as we now have: The rejection of which is to expoſe us to contempt and loathing; to harden Mens hearts againſt a juſt Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to make thoſe who are reformed, grow ſick and weary and aſhamed of the diſtracted unſetledneſs, and ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernableneſs of ſuch people: Who
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:179513:143"/>like nothing, but what is unlike to all the Churches of Chriſt that have been in the World, till this laſt unhappy Age.</p>
               <p>This cannot proceed from the Bleſſed Spirit of Grace; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lead Men to deſtroy the Church which Chriſt hath purchaſed by his Blood. Which, it is evident, cannot be preſerved, much leſs promoted, but by a due regard to thoſe who are over us in the Lord; and by adhering cloſely to ſuch an Authentick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, as that of this Church: which is the genuine Off-ſpring of the Apoſtles; declaring nothing to the people, but the true ſenſe of the Ancient Apoſtolick Church through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World. Which alwayes had ſuch Governours, of a ſuperiour Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Degree to other Miniſters, as we have: ſuch Prayers; ſuch Hymns; in a word, ſuch a Face of Religion, as is here ſeen in this our Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And may be ſeen, Bleſſed be God, in other Reformed Churches: parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in thoſe called <hi>Lutheran,</hi> who, as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> tells us, have had ſolemn
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:179513:143"/>Prayers every day; and much after the ſame Order, that is obſerved in ours. His words are theſe, <hi>Populus ſingulis diebus bis, certa hora,</hi> &amp;c. <q>The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſſemble every Day twice, at a certain hour,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exam. Concil. Trident. Pars</hi> iv. <hi>cap. ult.</hi>
                     </note> Morning and Evening, and after the ſinging of ſome Pſalms, Leſſons are read in order, partly out of the Old Teſtament, partly out of the New: And the Aſſembly concludes alwaies with <hi>Common Prayers,</hi> and ſome Hymn of Thankſgiving. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the people come together eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Week, on ſome certain Day, in greater Multitudes; to make Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Solemn Supplications, <hi>which are called Letanies.</hi> And ſo he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to relate how they Worſhip God, with the greateſt Solemnity on the Lord's Dayes; and upon ſpecial Feſtivals, in memory of the great Benefits we have received, on the <hi>Nativity, Circumciſion,</hi> &amp;c. in ſhort, on all the Dayes, now obſerved by our Church.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:179513:144"/>
               <p>O that there were ſuch an heart in us, as, inſtead of Wrangling and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputing, ſeriouſly to ſet our ſelves to make the beſt uſe we can, of ſuch Bleſſed Opportunities, as God ſtill affords unto us of meeting together every Day for his Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Eſpecially upon <hi>Letany Dayes,</hi> when there ought to be a fuller Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and more than ordinary Devotion. One of thoſe Dayes, at leaſt, I ſhould think every Devout Chriſtian may eaſily ſee, there is great cauſe to ſet apart every Week for Faſting and Humiliation; together with Supplication and Prayer to the Divine Majeſty, that he would turn away his Anger from us.</p>
               <p>Men are naturally too backward, I know, to ſuch Holy Imployments, and ſatisfie themſelves that they have an Excellent Religion, which they high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly value: without conſidering, that they have ſo much the greater Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon them, to joyn frequently in the Holy Offices thereof. Let that therefore, for a concluſion, be added to all the motives I have uſed in this Book, to ſtir you up to the conſtant
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:179513:144"/>performance of this Duty; that it will be the greateſt ſhame to us, if, when they whoſe Religion is a falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip have their conſtant Dayly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and attend upon it; we who have the trueſt Notions of God, and the moſt Excellent Religion, have leſs regard unto it: by which means their Religion, how corrupt ſoever it be, is upheld and maintained; and for want of this, ours, though never ſo pure, muſt needs fall to decay. For they that love the Religion they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, though it be not ſo ſincere and perfect as it ought to be, yet never fail to reap all the Benefits, which it is able to afford: and this among the reſt, that they keep their Religion, by their unfeigned Love to it, and Diligence in it. Whereas the beſt and ſoundeſt Religion profeſſed by thoſe who bear not the like Affection to it, yields thoſe who thus retain it, little or no benefit (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> hath obſerved) and by degrees is loſt, for want of a due regard, and earneſt Affection to it. We ſee this verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in <hi>Pagans, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks:</hi> Who zealouſly attend upon the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:179513:145"/>Offices of their Religion; and ſo continue their Sect.</p>
               <p>How comes their Religion to lead them to have frequent Aſſemblies, and ours to make us neglect them: But that they keep up their Love to their Religion, ſuch as it is; and we have loſt our firſt Love and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the loſs of our Religion? For had we a ſincere love to it, we ſhould be led, by the Natural Dictates of it, to attend upon its publick Offices (that being the very firſt thing to which Religion inclines us) and there to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with all ſeriouſneſs, both to the Prayers and Hymns, and to the Holy Scriptures which are then read unto us. And therefore our Religion hath gone to decay, becauſe we have not minded publick Aſſemblies dayly: but where they are kept up, they are empty and thin; or when they are full, there are none of theſe Natural ſigns of Devotion, in too many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which are among all Nations, (bended Knees, Hands, and Eyes lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up to Heaven) nay, they do not attend to the Word of God there read, but paſs it by, as a Tale that is told;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:179513:145"/>fancying, I ſuppoſe, it is never the Word of God, but when it is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is, ſpoken without Book.</p>
               <p>Theſe are not the Faults of all, nor I hope of moſt among us: But I have obſerved ſome of them (eſpecially the laſt, of Whiſpering together all the time the Scriptures are read, as if they were nothing but an empty ſound) in ſo many Perſons, from whoſe Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding one would expect better things, that I could not but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſuch unbecoming Behaviour in the Houſe of God. Where I beſeech. God to awaken all his Miniſters, to perform their Duty with careful Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: And all his People to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them reverently in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Prayers and Supplications: to the Glory of His Great Name, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of our Holy Religion, the Honour of this Church, the Increaſe of all true Godlineſs and Vertue among us; and the furtherance thereby of our Joyful Account, and Happy Meeting in the Day of the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Amen.</hi>
